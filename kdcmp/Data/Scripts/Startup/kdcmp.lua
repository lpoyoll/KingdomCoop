-- ===== Outbound State Emitter (WO-1) =====
-- The game has no push channel, so the agent used to poll: one HTTP call for

-- CVar and read it back. Measured at ~128 ms for one full sample, capping the
-- sync loop at 7.8 samples/s.
--
-- System.LogAlways costs ~20 us per line and kcd.log is readable by an external
-- tailer roughly 45 ms later, so the game can simply push instead. This emits
-- one line per tick; KcdMpClient tails the log. Three round trips become zero
-- and the rate becomes whatever this timer runs at.
--
-- Line format, space separated, fixed field count:
--   [KCD2-MP-DATA] v2 <seq> <clock> <x> <y> <z> <rotZ> <flags> <health> <stamina>
--
--   seq    monotonic, so the tailer can spot drops and reordering
--   clock  os.clock() at emit, so the agent can age the sample
--   flags  bit0 riding, bit1 sneaking, bit2 dead, bit3 unconscious   (2 and 3 are v2)
--
-- The version token is first so the parser can reject anything it does not
-- understand rather than misread it. Bump it on any field change.
--
-- WO-28 Flow A raised this v1 -> v2, appending health and stamina. WO-26
-- Phase 3 measured why: the line carried position, rotation and two booleans,
-- so when a test ghost was killed the player it represented kept playing at
-- full health and no peer had any way to know otherwise.
--
-- The agent parses BOTH versions (LogTailGameTransport). The pak and the agent
-- are separately installed and update independently, so a new agent reading an
-- old pak's v1 lines is an ordinary state, not a broken one: it degrades to
-- "health unknown" rather than rejecting every line.
--
-- Death rides here as a flag bit rather than as its own event line because the
-- emitter already runs at ~50 Hz and this costs nothing. It is still the
-- *dying player's own client* that declares the death on the wire (Protocol
-- 0x23) -- a peer never infers it from the health field reaching zero.

-- ===== pushing it ===========================================================

-- ShowTutorial is a NOTIFICATION QUEUE, not a panel you can update in place.
-- Two rounds of learning here, both from watching the real thing:
--
--   1. Pushing an update without hiding leaves it waiting BEHIND the current
--      entry, so the board silently stops tracking the match.
--   2. HideTutorial(id) only dismisses the entry being DISPLAYED -- it advances
--      the queue rather than clearing it. Sixteen pushes across one demo match
--      therefore left sixteen queued entries, each asking for a long duration,
--      and the game cycled through them: fade out, fade in, next. On screen that
--      reads as the board flickering and looping forever, long after the match
--      has ended.
--
-- So every push flushes the WHOLE queue first. HideAllTutorials is a blunt
-- instrument -- it will also drop a genuine game tutorial that happens to be
-- showing -- which is accepted only because this runs solely during a PvP dice
-- match the player deliberately started.
--
-- panelMs is a safety net, not the intended lifetime: if this code ever stops
-- refreshing (agent dies, script error), the board expires by itself instead of
-- sitting on screen forever.
-- MEASURED, not assumed: a demo match pushes the panel 24 times in 30 seconds,
-- roughly one every 1.25 s. Each push is HideAllTutorials + ShowTutorial and the
-- panel replays its full fade-out/fade-in every time. That is the "flickering
-- horribly" -- not a loop, and not something queue management can fix.
--
-- ShowTutorial is a NOTIFICATION CARD. There is no in-place text update, so
-- rapid repeated pushes flicker -- but not EVERY push is rapid. A relay-driven
-- DiceState (a roll/keep/bank result) is naturally paced by however long a
-- turn takes; the thing that actually flickered was pushing once per LOCAL
-- mark press too, which can happen several times a second while choosing a
-- keep. So the fix is not "never push the panel", it's "don't push once per
-- keystroke": KCD2MP_DiceRender still pushes immediately for state that's
-- already paced (open, DiceState, DiceError, end); scheduleRender below is
-- what marking uses instead, coalescing a burst of presses into one push.

-- ===== dice tables (WO-6 C1) ================================================
--
-- Real tables only -- this mod's dice UI must never appear anywhere a player
-- happens to be standing.
--
-- "DiceInteractor" is not a guess. Scripts.pak ships Entities/DiceInteractor.ent
-- registering that class against Scripts/Entities/WH/Minigames/DiceInteractor.lua,
-- the script that puts the "@ui_hud_play_dice" action on a dice board
-- (objects/manmade/task_specific_props/entertainment/games/dice/dice_board.cgf).
--
-- UNVERIFIED until Probe-Visual.ps1's `dicetable` block is run at a real tavern
-- table: whether world-placed tables are actually instances of this class.
-- If they are not, set KCD2MP.dice.tableClass = nil to fall back to a plain
-- proximity check between the two players -- honest, flagged, and not the
-- default.
-- WO-6 revision: the strict "must be at a DiceInteractor" gate is correct for
-- shipping but hostile to testing, because every dice table in the world is
-- already occupied by an NPC and we cannot drive the native minigame anyway.
-- So the gate is now a list of accepted classes plus a switch.
--

--   requireTable = true   -- shipping behaviour, must be at an accepted table

-- classes actually around the player so a generic table's real class name can be
-- ADDED to tableClasses from evidence rather than guessed at.

--
-- Note this detects "at a seat", not "currently seated": player:GetStance() is

-- honest to call it that.

-- ===== NPC sync (WO-32) =====
--
-- One player's world dictating what nearby hand-placed NPCs are doing in
-- everyone's world. Built on WO-32's live findings, all observed on a real
-- NPC (ttkc_man_16), not a ghost:
--
--   * A single external SetWorldPos LANDS but the engine restores the NPC to
--     its byte-identical schedule anchor within ~1.5 s. One write is nothing.
--   * A continuous 50 ms write stream WINS completely -- the NPC tracked an
--     external drive across metres with no AI suppression of any kind, while
--     dialogue, crime state and nearby NPCs stayed completely undisturbed.
--   * When the stream stops, the engine restores the NPC to its own schedule
--     by itself (back on anchor within 3 s, talkable, no side effects). So
--     "release" is simply: stop writing.
--   * StartAnimation works on a real NPC exactly as on a ghost, and without
--     it the NPC slides in whatever pose its current activity holds.
--
-- Emitting side (the Rule 2 world authority only): a slow tick tracks up to
-- npcSync.maxTracked NPCs within npcSync.radius of the player and emits an
-- npc_state event line per NPC on movement, on a health change, or on a slow
-- heartbeat. Runtime-spawned entities (ghosts, horses) are excluded -- this
-- layer moves EXISTING authored NPCs, it never creates or names one.
--
-- Receiving side: KCD2MP_ApplyNpcState targets a puppet entry; a 50 ms tick
-- (same cadence family as the ghost interp) lerps the local copy of that NPC
-- toward the stream and drives a walk/run animation from the rendered speed.
-- A puppet that stops receiving packets for releaseS seconds is dropped and
-- the engine takes the NPC back -- that is the whole restore path, verified
-- live before this was built.

    -- Passed correctly, the ghost gets the roster soul's real face, faction
    -- identity, reputation log and combat level -- and, verified live, it
    -- RECOVERS from being knocked unconscious (<=54s and <=26s over two
    -- cycles) where a brainless ghost stayed down forever. That is A1 from
    -- WO-16-release-candidate.md, fixed. See docs/WO-22-brain-lead.md.

    -- SchedulerProxyName is deliberately NOT passed. It is what would make the
    -- ghost pick its own activities and walk off under its own power, which
    -- fights KCD2MP_InterpTick's position stream. It is not needed for the
    -- recovery fix -- the soul alone buys that -- so a ghost spawned this way

    -- inert and that "IdleSeq" names no tree anywhere in the shipped game
    -- data. It was never a live variable, so the aggro toggle's switch on it
    -- was a no-op. A soul-backed ghost's reactive combat (self-defense,
    -- joining nearby fights) comes from the engine's own AI/soul/brain
    -- system once SharedSoulGuid is bound here, and is always on regardless
    -- of the aggro toggle (WO-26). The toggle's own effect is a separate,
    -- additive native hostile-faction attach applied at hit-time, not at

--      (KCD2MP_SetGhostDead deliberately leaves it), but it no longer stands

--   2. An NPC killed the ghost in THIS world. No packet is involved at all --
--      worlds are not shared (docs/WO-26-shared-combat-design.md s2), so the
--      owner may be alive and well and completely unaware. Nothing in the mod
--      had ever looked at the ghost entity's own death state, which is why
--      this case went unnoticed through WO-28.

-- the same object sampleGhostHealth already calls GetHealth() on, so it adds
-- one native call to a path that was already making one. pcall'd and treated

-- What that session established, so nobody re-walks it:
--   - REAL full swings are 1d- blendspaces (parametric by attack angle).
--     StartAnimation "starts" them (returns true) but they never render,
--     and the plain "natk_slash_*_upper" clips are upper-guard partials
--     that read as blocking. Swings are Mannequin-locked on this build.
--   - Human.PlayAnim(fragment, tags) executes fault-free and renders
--     NOTHING for FreeAttack/CombatAttack/CombatHit/FreeBlock on a ghost.
--   - What DOES render correctly via StartAnimation: guard idles, the
--     dz "blk" block reactions, hit "flinch" reactions, and guard
--     TRANSITIONS. Naming decode: lg/rg = left/right guard (rg raises the
--     sword arm and reads correctly; lg raises the EMPTY left arm and
--     reads like phantom-shield blocking), sz = distance zone, az/dz =
--     attack/defense zone.
-- The swing cue therefore is a fast right-to-left guard transition -- a

-- ===== Ghost reconciliation after a save load (WO-28 Phase 0) =====
--
-- Measured live, 2026-08-07: loading a save destroys every ghost ENTITY in the
-- world, but KCD2MP.ghosts keeps holding the entity table it was given at spawn
-- time. That table stays non-nil -- it is a Lua value, and nothing about the
-- world unload reaches in and clears it -- so KCD2MP_UpdateGhost's own
-- "spawn if missing" test (`if not ghost or not ghost.entity`) reads as
-- "present" forever and the ghost is never respawned.
--
-- What that looks like in game, in the human's own words while it was
-- happening: *"the ghost is invisible for me but I can see its nametag
-- continuing in the same path"* -- because istate keeps taking position
-- packets and KCD2MP_InterpTick keeps writing labelCache from it, with no
-- body under the label. It never recovers on its own.
--
-- The check has to be a real world lookup by spawn name (never the display
-- name -- WO-26 established that is not a key anything resolves by), which is
-- too expensive for the 20 ms interp path. So the agent calls this on a slow
-- cadence instead, the same shape as WO-13's KCD2MP_StartInterp re-arm.
--
-- Deliberately drops only the bookkeeping rather than calling
-- KCD2MP_RemoveGhost: there is no entity left to remove, the display name and
-- menu/health/death tags are all still correct for that player, and the very
-- next position packet respawns the body through the ordinary path.

-- ===== WO-20 — deterministic face roster (guidSharedSoulId) =====
--
-- The appearance lever -- binding a spawned NPC's guidSharedSoulId spawn
-- property to a real soul's SharedSoulGuid, which makes the engine build a
-- full distinct head+body+hair+beard automatically -- is Jefferson25625's
-- find (AppearanceApi.md, github.com/DeepFriedDepp/kcd2-exports fork, used
-- with permission). Confirmed live against this project's own build
-- (docs/WO-20-faces.md), not trusted from their doc.
--
-- Their own soul_roster.lua (the actual 48-soul GUID list) was never
-- committed to the repo -- prose only, same pattern WO-18 found for their
-- whole C# stack. So this roster is our own: real, hand-placed souls pulled
-- live from this save's own SoulsByName and spread across settlements for
-- visual variety. SharedSoulGuid is the authored, cross-session-stable key
-- (NATIVE-PLUGIN-findings.md), so these values hold regardless of which save
-- or session picks them.
--
-- WO-34: it was 48 (24 male, 24 female) and it is now 43 (19 male, 24
-- female). Five of the male entries were NOT commoners -- tbuk_man_5,
-- tkop_man_1, tkop_man_2, tzda_man_6 and tzda_man_9 were bandits, and are
-- gone. Read off the shipped tables, not inferred:
--
--   soul__tkop.xml   factionName = trosecko_enemies_bandits_campKopanina
--                    social_class_id = 38  voice_group_name = Bandits
--   social_class.xml 38 -> social_class_name "bandit", soul_crime_role_id 3
--   soul_crime_role  3  -> "renegade"
--   FactionTree.xml  ancestor trosecko_enemies carries Labels="publicEnemy"
--                    and reputation="-1" toward every trosecko settlement,
--                    outskirt, miller and ally faction
--   text_ui_soul.xml soul_ui_name_ruffian -> "Ruffian"
--
-- Until WO-22 this was harmless: the GUID was passed nested under Properties
-- and bound no soul at all, so the roster was decorative and the faction
-- never applied. WO-22 made SharedSoulGuid a real top-level parameter, which
-- turned five of these slots into genuinely hostile public enemies. Live
-- two-player report (WO-34): players hostile to each other on sight, one
-- attacked by ambient NPCs, bandit combat barks, and a corpse labelled
-- "Ruffian". KCD2MP_SpawnGhost's AI.ChangeParameter(..., "Civilians")
-- override does not defeat the soul row.
--
-- Removing rather than replacing takes the male #list from 24 to 19, and
-- KCD2MP_PickFaceForPlayer's modulus is over #list, so EVERY male player's
-- face changes with this build, not only the five. Accepted deliberately
-- (see docs/WO-34-findings.md); appearance stability across a version was
-- already broken once by WO-22 for the same underlying reason.

-- "show connected players on the map" feature needs, because each ghost is
-- already a real local entity whose position the mod keeps synced; marking
-- the ENTITY means the map marker moves for free. But this is a Crysis-era
-- GameRules bind against KCD2's custom Warhorse map UI, and this project has
-- already met documented-but-unregistered binds (Actor.SetAIBrainId, WO-32)
-- and registered-but-inert ones (most AI writes). So the feature ships as a
-- PROBE first: run `mp_map_marker <type>` live with a ghost present, open
-- the map, and see. If a type value renders, wiring it into SpawnGhost is a
-- three-line follow-up.
-- Usage: mp_map_marker <typeInt>   (tries that icon type on every ghost)

-- ===== Dropped-item sync (WO-48) =====
--
-- A player deliberately drops an item; peers see it appear, and whoever picks
-- it up first gets it -- for everyone. TRANSACTIONAL (the time-skip shape):
-- a drop broadcasts once, sits inert, and resolves on the first claim the
-- relay echoes back. No continuous stream, no authority to hand off. Chests
-- and NPC pockets are deliberately NOT synced (independent loot pools).
--
-- The reachable surface, all live-verified in WO-48 Phase 1:
--   detect:      new PickableItem entity near the player (GetEntitiesInSphere)
--                + that class's inventory count DECREASED since last tick --
--                both halves required, which is what filters out world items
--                streaming in and NPCs dropping things nearby.
--   identity:    Properties.sItemClassId (the WO-9 ItemClass GUID) + nAmount
--                + fHealth read straight off the ground entity. The dropId
--                itself is minted by the agent (random uint32) and handled as
--                a STRING here -- this Lua's floats corrupt integers > 2^24.
--   spawn:       inventory:CreateItem on a ghost + ghost.human:PlaceItem to a
--                throwaway anchor entity at the drop position. Placing while
--                the player was 60 m away dropped the item through unstreamed
--                ground (observed: z -217), so pending drops only materialize
--                inside materializeRadius.
--   pickup:      the tracked ground entity vanishing WITHOUT this mod having
--                removed it = something in this world took it. Removal by the
--                mod flags removedByUs first (the damage layer's loop-
--                prevention idiom, local state, never on the wire).

-- Dice overlay keys (WO-6).
--
-- Second design. The first tried R/F/X/1-6 -- keys the game's OWN action map
-- already binds to something (toggle_torch, knock_out, call, action_qam_N) --
-- on the reasoning that our OnAction hook runs alongside the game's handler
-- and cannot consume input, so the key's normal side effect had to be
-- tolerable. Two things broke that plan in real play:
--   1. 1-6 also fires action_qam_N's WEAPON/food slot select, not just a
--      cosmetic toggle -- a live match drew a sword mid-game.
--   2. R (toggle_torch) turned out unreliable while seated -- exactly the
--      position this feature is for.
--
-- keybindSuperactions.xml (Libs/Config/, shipped in this mod's own pak) is
-- the actual fix: it is a plain, moddable XML action-map config, not
-- hardcoded, and a key can carry MULTIPLE named actions across different
-- `map=` contexts simultaneously. So instead of reusing an existing action
-- and hoping its side effect is harmless, this ships brand-new action names
-- (kcd2mp_dice_mark_1..6, kcd2mp_dice_cast, kcd2mp_dice_bank,
-- kcd2mp_dice_yield) on physical keys confirmed to have NOTHING else bound
-- to them anywhere in the file, so there is no side effect to tolerate at
-- all. map="interaction" was chosen because it was directly observed still
-- firing (use/talk/trigger_use) immediately after sitting down, unlike
-- "sitting"-shadowed actions.
--
-- Keys: F2, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8 mark dice 1-6 (see DICE_MARK_KEYS in the
-- panel code); F9 casts/sets aside; hold F11 banks; hold F12 yields; U
-- clears every pending mark without rerolling (KCD2MP_DiceUnmarkAll).
--
-- Four traps paid for finding these, none visible from this file alone:
--   1. Numpad 1-6 checked clean here (nothing else in this XML claims them)
--      but wasn't -- action_qam_N's weapon_slot_N sibling lives under
--      apse_qam_slots, which turned out to stay active during ordinary
--      play, not just with a menu open. Adding our own action to a key
--      never suppresses whatever else is already bound there.
--   2. The Numpad operator keys (*, +, -) and F1/F3/F10 are bound to
--      engine-level debug toggles (photo mode, flight mode, AI/animation
--      debug draw) entirely OUTSIDE this XML -- invisible to any check of
--      this file's contents. Numpad / is worse: it CRASHED the game.
--   3. H is also "clean" by this file's contents and is not safe either --
--      it opens a Modding Tools debug menu, same invisible-to-this-file
--      shape as trap 2. Every key actually used below was pressed live,
--      one at a time, and watched for anything happening at all -- that is
--      the only real proof; this file's contents are not enough on their
--      own, and neither is "nothing obviously bad happened" (Numpad 1-6).
--   4. Numpad . is a DIFFERENT kind of failure: not dangerous, just a dead
--      binding. "np_decimal" is not a control name this engine's action-map
--      recognises at all, so the whole entry silently never registers --
--      no crash, no debug menu, just nothing, indistinguishable at a glance
--      from a key that works but has nothing to do yet. Moved to U, which
--      is both unclaimed AND confirmed to actually fire once wired up.
--
-- Bank/yield tried U/Y briefly (to leave F11/F12 free for a future
-- invite-accept/decline bind) -- U/Y worked, but simplicity won: back on
-- F11/F12, which were already proven end-to-end, and U repurposed for
-- cancel instead of adding a fifth key family to the set.
--
-- All of these are gated on KCD2MP.dice.open, so none can fire outside a
-- match. The mp_dice_* console commands remain and always work.
