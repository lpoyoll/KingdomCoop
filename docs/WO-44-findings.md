# WO-44 — combat-swing fidelity, Phase 2: why rung 1 stalls, decompiled. Direction B is required.

Worked 2026-08-22 (Fable 5). This is the Phase 2 handoff WO-43 called for: a
disassembler pass on the one function WO-42 traced *to* but never read *into* —
`EntityModule.dll+0xAE17A0`, the concrete target `C_Actor` vtable slot `+0xE48`
resolves to, which WO-43 live-tested three times and found produces a
reproducible, broken partial swing. WO-43 was forbidden a disassembler; this
session was told to open one, and did (Ghidra 12.1.3, the WO-42 pipeline, the
WO-42 projects reused — §7).

**Evidence classes, as elsewhere in this project:** observed (read directly out
of the disassembly this session) / read-but-unrendered (a mechanism traced in
code but never executed in a running game) / inferred (a step beyond the bytes,
labelled). No game was launched this session — everything below is static, and
the one new native artifact is a *precondition probe* that a future session with
a human at the machine will run (§6).

## ⚠ Correction (added one session later, live-testing this document's own §6 probe)

**The premise this document opens with — "WO-43 live-tested three times and
found produces a reproducible, broken partial swing" — is wrong.** A follow-up
session ran this document's own `combat_construct.cpp` and `combat_playanim.cpp`
probes against real, freshly-validated ghosts and found `actor[+0x28]->
vtbl[0x80]()` (the guard `C_ScriptBindHuman::PlayAnim` checks before ever
touching `+0xE48`) returns `0` — blocks — on every ghost tested, three for
three. `vtbl[+0xE48]` is never called at all for a ghost. The "broken partial
swing" WO-43 described (and this document set out to explain) was
`DrawWeapon()`'s own incomplete-looking stance — confirmed directly, live, by
calling `DrawWeapon()` alone with no swing attempt and reproducing the
identical pose on two separate untouched ghosts. Full detail in
`docs/WO-43-findings.md`'s own correction section, written at the same time.

**What this changes and what it doesn't.** §1's decompilation of
`EntityModule.dll+0xAE17A0` = `C_Player::PlayAnim` is real, was actually read
out of the disassembly, and is accurate — **for the player**, whose guard
this session separately measured as passing (`1`) live. What it does *not* do
is explain the ghost's behavior, because a ghost's call never reaches
`0xAE17A0` or any other function at `+0xE48` — the guard stops it first, one
step earlier than this document assumed. §2's class-dispatch finding (ghosts
present a `C_NPCActor`-family vtable, not `C_Player`'s) is *also* still real
and was independently live-confirmed the same session this correction was
written (vptr `EntityModule.dll+0xE98340` on two different ghosts, matching
this section's own static identification) — it just turned out to be
answering a question that, for the guard-blocked case, doesn't end up
mattering: whichever class's `+0xE48` a ghost has, it's never reached.

**Phase 2's actual recommendation is unaffected, and arguably stronger.**
Direction B (§4-§6: build and queue a real `C_CombatAnimAction` through
`GetOrCreateCombatActor`/`C_CombatAnimActionManager`, not a bare fragment call)
was already this document's conclusion. It now rests on two independent,
correctly-attributed reasons instead of one that turned out to be
misattributed: (1) even when a bare `PlayAnim` call *does* go through (the
player's case, confirmed), it structurally cannot complete a combat swing
(§1, unaffected by this correction); and (2) for a ghost specifically, the
call does not go through at all — the guard blocks it, for a reason not yet
identified (see the open question this correction leaves below). Building the
real combat action bypasses both problems at once: it never calls `+0xE48` or
depends on its guard.

**New open question this correction surfaces, for whoever picks this up
next:** what does `actor[+0x28]->vtbl[0x80]()` actually gate on? **Tried and
still blocked:** a real combat actor already existing (via
`GetOrCreateCombatActor`, confirmed present on the same ghost immediately
before this recheck) does not change the outcome — guard still `0`. So it is
not gated on combat-actor existence. Four for four ghosts tested (untouched,
weapon-drawn, and combat-actor-present) all blocked; the player (tested
separately, live) passes. The simplest hypothesis fitting all the data:
this guard checks something like "is this actor a live, input-driven
player," not any per-object combat/equipment state — which a scripted ghost
puppet would never satisfy no matter what else is set up on it. Not yet
confirmed by reading the guard function itself (that would need one more
short disassembly pass, out of scope for a live-testing session) — stated
here as the leading hypothesis, not a settled fact.

---

## 0. Verdict (as originally written, now superseded — see correction above)

**Direction A is closed, decisively and by decompilation: rung 1 (the
`PlayAnim` / `vtbl+0xE48` call) fundamentally cannot produce a complete combat
swing, and no cheap precondition salvages it.**

`EntityModule.dll+0xAE17A0` is `C_Player::PlayAnim`. It is a **generic
single-fragment player**: it parses the fragment name into a fragment ID, parses
the tag string into a 20-byte `TagState`, allocates a **bare
`TAction<SAnimationContext>` (0x90 bytes)**, and queues it through
`IActionController::Queue` (+0x98). It **never constructs a combat action, never
touches the combat-actor state machine, never resolves an attack descriptor, and
never installs the combat lifecycle delegates.** (§1, observed.)

That is exactly why a combat swing stalls partway. A self-contained fragment
(a jump — `MotionJump`, WO-40) plays to completion as a bare `TAction` because
nothing else has to drive it. A combat attack is **not** self-contained: in the
game's own code it is entered by `C_CombatActorActionAttack::EnterImpl`
(WO-42 §5.2), which builds a `C_CombatAnimAction` (0x1A8, ten times the machinery
of a bare `TAction`) and queues it through the actor's **`C_CombatAnimActionManager`**,
wrapped in combat-state pre-roll, an attack helper, lifecycle delegates and
post-queue attack selection. Queue the same fragment ID + tags as a *bare
`TAction`* and the character enters the motion (draws the weapon, begins the
swing) but nothing advances the combat scopes/transition tags to completion — a
stuck partial pose. **This is precisely WO-43's three-times-reproduced
observation, now explained.** (§3.)

There is **no branch** in `0xAE17A0` that would ever build a combat action; it
unconditionally allocates the 0x90 bare `TAction`. So "add one precondition and
rung 1 works" is ruled out: the primitive is the wrong primitive, not a
correctly-shaped call missing a flag.

**Therefore Phase 2 must take direction B** — build and queue a real combat
action object. This session re-verified direction B's entry points against the
installed binaries (§4), wrote a complete rung-2/rung-3 construction spec (§5),
and shipped a **safe precondition probe** (`combat_construct.cpp`, §6) that
resolves the ghost's `I_CombatActor*` and logs every pointer the construction
route consumes — so the next session can confirm the inputs resolve on a live
ghost before allocating or queueing anything.

**One correction to WO-43's framing, carried honestly:** WO-43 (and this
session's brief) call `0xAE17A0` "the concrete implementation `C_Actor::vtbl[+0xE48]`
resolves to." That is exactly right for the **player** — `0xAE17A0` is
`C_Player`'s `+0xE48` and the only vtable in the whole module that carries it
(§2). It is **not** literally the same function for a non-`C_Player` actor: the
byte offset `+0xE48` is a `C_Player`-specific slot (`C_Human`'s primary vtable is
shorter and has nothing there). What ran on the *ghosts* in WO-43 was therefore
either a `C_Player`-layout actor's `0xAE17A0`, or a class-sibling of it — the
same *kind* of bare-fragment player (the observed behaviour was identical). The
probe in §6 settles which, by logging the ghost actor's vptr. This does not
change the verdict — a bare-fragment player, of whatever class, cannot complete a
combat swing — but the project's evidence discipline requires the distinction be
stated, not rounded over.

## 1. `EntityModule.dll+0xAE17A0` = `C_Player::PlayAnim`, fully read

RVA `0xAE17A0`, image base `0x180000000` → `0x180AE17A0`. **Observed** (the
Ghidra decompilation and disassembly are reproduced in the scratch outputs;
`native/ghidra_scripts` regenerates them, §7). It is not string-anchored — the
`PlayAnim` Lua-registration string lives in the *caller*
(`C_ScriptBindHuman`), not here — but it is reached unambiguously three ways:
it is `C_Player::vftable` slot `[457]` = byte `+0xE48` (§2); it is what
`C_ScriptBindHuman::PlayAnim` (`0xB3D5C0`) calls at `+0xE48` (§2); and WO-43's
native diagnostic on the actual player logged `actor->vtbl[+0xE48] =
EntityModule.dll+0xAE17A0` at runtime (WO-43 §4).

Annotated reconstruction (register/offset facts from the disassembly, not the
decompiler's parameter guesses):

```c
void C_Player__PlayAnim(longlong* self,           // RCX  the C_Player (C_Actor)
                        const char* fragmentName,  // RDX
                        byte*       tags)          // R8   "tag1+tag2+..." or null
{
    // ---- 1. fragment name -> fragment ID -----------------------------------

    void*  ctx       = animCtrl->vtbl[0xB8](animCtrl);            // controller context
    int    fragmentID = FindFragmentIndex(ctx->[+0x18], nameCrc); // FUN_180123CB0
    if (fragmentID == -1) return;                                 // unknown fragment: no-op

    // ---- 2. tag string -> 20-byte TagState ---------------------------------
    uint8 tagState[20] = {0};
    if (tags && *(int*)(tags - 8) /*len*/ != 0) {
        // split on '+', CRC32-lower each tag, look it up in the context's tag
        // definition table, and set/clear the corresponding TagState bits.
        // (This is the whole middle of the function -- it works: the fragment
        //  DOES start playing, so the parse is correct.)
        ... per-tag: local_60[group] |= bit; ...
    }

    // ---- 3. stop whatever is currently playing -----------------------------
    self->vtbl[0xE50](self);         // C_Player slot [458] = clears self+0xD50

    // ---- 4. allocate a BARE action -- 0x90 bytes ---------------------------
    void* action = CryMalloc(0x90);                              // <-- the tell
    void* built  = nullptr;
    if (action)
        built = TAction_ctor(action, /*priority*/ 5, fragmentID, tagState); // FUN_180121300

    // ---- 5. refcounted store into self+0xD50 (self[0x1AA]) ------------------
    if (built != self->[0x1AA]) { AddRef(built); Release(self->[0x1AA]); self->[0x1AA] = built; }

    // ---- 6. QUEUE via the plain action controller --------------------------
    void* ac = self->vtbl[0x2D0](self)->vtbl[0x130]();           // GetActionController
    ac->vtbl[0x98](ac, self->[0x1AA], -1.0f);                    // IActionController::Queue
}
```

The load-bearing facts, all **observed** in the disassembly:

| fact | where | value |
|---|---|---|
| allocation size | `MOV ECX,0x90` before `CryMalloc` (dec. line `lVar11 = (*DAT_1812cebd0)(0x90,...)`) | **0x90** |
| the constructor called | `FUN_180121300` | writes `IAction::vftable` then **`TAction<SAnimationContext>::vftable`** — a *bare* Mannequin action (RTTI-labelled) |
| priority | ctor arg 2 | **5** |
| fragment ID | ctor arg 3 | from the name-CRC lookup |
| TagState | ctor arg 4 (20 bytes, `local_60`) | from the tag-string parse |
| queue call | `ac->vtbl[0x98](ac, action, 0xBF800000)` | **`IActionController::Queue(IAction&, -1.0f)`** |

`FUN_180121300` (the `TAction<SAnimationContext>` ctor, EntityModule's copy at
RVA `0x121300`) is **field-for-field the same** ctor WO-42 §3 documented in
AnimationModule (`0x100250`) and CombatModule (`0x10BA90`): priority at `+0x24`,
fragmentID at `+0x38`, `-1.0f` at `+0x14`, 20-byte TagState memcpy'd to `+0x3C`,
scope mask at `+0x54`, refcount at `+0x58`, the two static container sentinels at
`+0x68`/`+0x88`. **Observed** — this session read its body and it matches WO-42
exactly. That is the strongest possible confirmation that what `PlayAnim` builds
is the *bare base action*, with none of the combat subclass on top.

**The comparison that makes the verdict crisp.** `PlayAnim` and the correct
combat route parse the *identical* `(fragmentID, TagState)`. The only
differences are the action **type** and the queue **path**:

| | `C_Player::PlayAnim` (rung 1, closed) | `C_CombatActorAction*::EnterImpl` (the game's real swing) |
|---|---|---|
| action object | `TAction<SAnimationContext>`, **0x90** | `C_CombatAnimAction`, **0x1A8** |
| built by | `TAction_ctor` (`0x121300`) | `C_CombatAnimAction` ctor (`0xF26F0`), which calls the *same* TAction ctor then adds the combat vftable + four lifecycle `std::function` delegates + the asset-GUID slot |
| queued through | `IActionController::Queue` (+0x98) **directly** | `C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction` (`0xF3C00`) — which *also* ends at `Queue` (+0x98) but is reached only after the full combat pre-roll |
| combat state | **none** | pre-roll of `combat+0xD28/0xE28/0xD68`, attack-helper init, attack selection, post-queue hooks (WO-42 §5.2 steps 4-11) |
| lifecycle | none | `OnAnimEntered`/`OnAnimFinished` delegates drive the transition |

A combat fragment's later scopes and transition tags (the `eZ1`/`aZ2`/`slash`
"attack-zone" tags in the real rows, WO-42 §9.2) are advanced by that combat
machinery. Strip it and the fragment enters but never transitions out of its
entry — the stuck partial pose. **This is direction A's answer.**

---

## 2. The class-dispatch subtlety (settles WO-43 §9.6's open boundary)

WO-42 §9.6 flagged, and WO-43 inherited, an open question: *which concrete
class's vtable does `+0xE48` resolve to?* WO-42 noted a probe of `C_NPCActor`'s
table at `+0xE48` "landed on an unrelated getter." This session resolves it.

**Observed:**

- `C_Player::vftable` is at RVA `0xE96F78`. Its slot `[457]` = byte `+0xE48` =
  **`0xAE17A0`** (`PlayAnim`). Confirmed two independent ways: a full 470-slot
  vtable dump, and walking back from the raw slot address `0xE97DC0`
  (= `0xE96F78 + 0xE48`) to its owning vtable label.
- **`0xAE17A0` is referenced by exactly one real vtable slot in the entire
  module** — that C_Player one. (The four other data-refs to `0xAE17A0` decode
  as packed 32-bit RVA pairs, i.e. `.pdata`/EH `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` triples — the
  exact trap `native/ghidra_scripts/README.md` warns of; verified by reading
  them: they yield the nonsense "pointer" `0xAE182A00AE17A0`, two glued RVAs.)
- `C_Human`'s **primary** vtable (the one its ctor at `0x7D7CA0` writes to
  `[this+0]`, RVA `0xE44C58`) is **shorter than C_Player's**: the next vtable
  begins at `0xE459D0`, only ~431 slots in. So byte `+0xE48` (slot 457) is
  **past the end** of `C_Human`'s primary vtable — reading it lands in adjacent
  data. `C_Human` has no `PlayAnim` at `+0xE48`; its `PlayAnim`, if virtual, is
  at a lower slot.
- `C_NPCActor`'s primary vtable (ctor `0xACBEE0` writes `0xE98340` to `[this+0]`)
  has a 28-byte stub returning a static pointer at `+0xE48` — again not
  `PlayAnim`.

**Consequence, stated precisely.** `C_ScriptBindHuman::PlayAnim` (`0xB3D5C0`)
hard-codes `actor->vtbl[+0xE48]` (re-read this session — the guard and call are
exactly as WO-42 §9.6 gave them: `actor[+0x28]->vtbl[0x80]() != 0`, then
`actor->vtbl[0xE48](actor, fragment, tags)`). That offset is calibrated for
`C_Player`. For it to have rendered on WO-40's and WO-43's ghosts, those ghosts'
actors must present a `C_Player`-compatible layout at `+0xE48` — i.e. the ghost's
resolved `C_Actor*` is (or is laid out like) a `C_Player`, **not** a `C_NPCActor`
whose `+0xE48` is a stub. **This is a live-checkable claim, not a settled one**;
the §6 probe logs the ghost's vptr and compares it to `C_Player::vftable`
(`0xE96F78`) to decide it directly. Either way the direction-A verdict holds:
whatever the ghost's `+0xE48` is, WO-43 observed it produce a bare partial swing,
consistent with a bare-fragment player.

This also means direction B should **not** rely on `+0xE48` or any other
vtable-slot offset that varies by leaf class. It should use `C_Actor`'s
*non-virtual* combat entry point, `GetOrCreateCombatActor` (§4), which works from
any `C_Actor*` regardless of concrete class.

---

## 3. Why a bare `TAction` stalls a swing but not a jump (read-but-unrendered)

Stated as a mechanism, one step beyond the bytes and labelled as such
(**inferred** from the combat construction sequence WO-42 §5.2 observed, plus §1
observed here):

- A Mannequin **fragment** is a set of animation clips keyed by scope + tags. A
  bare `TAction<SAnimationContext>` installed via `IActionController::Queue`
  gets the fragment's *entry* onto the scopes the fragment declares, at
  priority 5, and the action controller plays it.
- A **jump/motion** fragment (`MotionJump`, confirmed live WO-40) is
  self-terminating on its default scope — entry plays through to its natural end,
  so a bare `TAction` renders it fully. This is exactly what `PlayAnim` is *for*:
  its own binary description (AnimationModule `C_PlayAnim`) is *"Play given
  animation fragment. Stops immediately. Use just for low level testing!"*
  (WO-42 §6) — a low-level, fire-and-forget fragment player.
- A **combat attack** fragment carries transition tags (`eZ1`, `aZ2`, `slash`,
  `attack_heavy`, WO-42 §9.2) whose advancement is driven by the
  `C_CombatActorAction` state machine and its lifecycle delegates
  (`OnAnimEntered`→`FUN_1800F2CE0(anim,6)`, `OnAnimFinished`→`OnActionDone`,
  WO-42 §5.2). With no combat action object present, nothing fires those
  transitions; the fragment enters and holds. Result: weapon drawn, swing begun,
  frozen mid-motion — WO-43's observation, three times over.

This is **read-but-unrendered** as a runtime claim: it is the only reading
consistent with (a) `0xAE17A0` building a bare `TAction` (observed), (b) the
combat route building a `C_CombatAnimAction` with delegates (WO-42 observed), and
(c) the live partial-swing (WO-43 observed). It is not independently re-run here.

---

## 4. Direction B entry points, re-verified against the installed binaries this session

Every address below was **re-decompiled this session** from the WO-42 Ghidra
projects (which survived — §7) and matches WO-42's findings. Re-verifying rather
than trusting, per the project bar.

**`C_Actor::GetOrCreateCombatActor` — EntityModule RVA `0x92260`.** The
class-agnostic way to get an `I_CombatActor*` from any `C_Actor*`. Reconstructed,
**observed**:

```c
I_CombatActor* GetOrCreateCombatActor(C_Actor* self) {          // RCX
    if (!self->vtbl[0x988](self)) return nullptr;               // combat-capable?
    if (self->[+0x300] == nullptr) {                            // m_pCombatActor
        void* cls = self->vtbl[0x498](self);                    // GetActorClass
        if (cls->vtbl[0x28](cls)) {                             // class combat-capable
            self->[+0x300] = GetGameIface()->[0x100]            // combat module iface
                                ->vtbl[0x58](module, self);     // CreateCombatActor(C_Actor&)
            if (InitCombatActor(self)) { ... }                  // RVA 0x92310
        }
    }
    return self->[+0x300];
}
```

Confirms, this session: `C_Actor::m_pCombatActor` is at **`+0x300`** (WO-41's
`+0x278` is wrong, as WO-42 §9.5 already found); `vtbl[0x988]` is the
combat-capability predicate; `vtbl[0x498]` is `GetActorClass`; `vtbl[0x490]` is
`GetName` (used in `InitCombatActor`'s error string, RVA `0x92310`, anchored by
its own `__FUNCTION__` at `0xD43A30`). `__fastcall`, `this` in RCX, returns the
pointer in RAX.

**`C_CombatAnimAction` ctor — CombatModule RVA `0xF26F0`.** Re-decompiled,
**observed**, matches WO-42 §4.2:

```c
C_CombatAnimAction* ctor(void* mem,          // RCX  freshly CryMalloc'd 0x1A8 block
                         void* /*unused*/,    // RDX
                         void* combatActor,   // R8   I_CombatActor*
                         uint32 priority,     // R9D  5 for attack/sync-attack
                         uint32 fragmentID,   // [rsp+0x20]
                         const void* tags20,  // [rsp+0x28]  20-byte TagState
                         uint32 flags) {      // [rsp+0x30]  game passes 0
    TAction_ctor(mem, priority, fragmentID, tags20, flags, 0);  // the same base ctor
    mem->[0]     = C_CombatAnimAction::vftable;
    mem->[0x90]  = 0; mem->[0x98] = 0;
    mem->[0xD8]  = mem->[0x118] = mem->[0x158] = mem->[0x198] = 0;  // 4 delegate slots
    mem->[0x94]  = flags;
    mem->[0x9C]  = *(uint32*)(*(void**)((char*)combatActor + 0x2D8) + 0x30);
    return mem;
}
```

**`C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction` — CombatModule RVA `0xF3C00`.**
Re-decompiled, **observed**, matches WO-42 §5.2b:

```c
void QueueAction(void* manager,                              // RCX
                 _smart_ptr<C_CombatAnimAction>* sp,          // RDX  by reference
                 float time) {                                // XMM2  -1.0f
    void* animChar = (*(void***)((char*)*(void**)manager + 0x2D8))->vtbl[0x2D0]();
    void* ac       = animChar->vtbl[0x130]();                 // GetActionController
    if (ac && ((*sp)->[+0x28] == 0 || (*sp)->[+0x28] == 4)) { // action status gate
        ... trace log (reads fragmentID +0x38, TagState +0x3C..+0x4C) ...
        ac->vtbl[0x98](ac, *sp, time);                        // IActionController::Queue
    }
    // consumes one reference on sp
}
```

Ownership rule an implementer must respect (WO-42 §5.2b, re-confirmed):
`QueueAction` **consumes one reference**. AddRef = `action->vtbl[0x08]`,
Release = `vtbl[0x10]`, refcount at `action+0x58`, destroy virtual `vtbl[0xB8]`.

## 5. The direction-B construction spec (ready to implement; not built this session)

Two rungs, both feeding off the pointers the §6 probe confirms. Presented with
the trade-off explicit, because they differ in confidence, not just effort.

### Rung 2 — build a `C_CombatAnimAction`, queue it through the actor's own manager

The smallest step up from rung 1 that adds real combat machinery. **Same
`(fragmentID, TagState)` parse rung 1 already does correctly** — the only changes
are the action *type* (`0x1A8` `C_CombatAnimAction` instead of `0x90` bare
`TAction`) and the queue *path* (the combat manager instead of the plain action
controller).

```
1. combatActor = GetOrCreateCombatActor(actor)         // EntityModule 0x92260
2. (fragmentID, tags20[20]) = parse "FragmentId, tags" // see "the parse" below
3. mem = CryMalloc(0x1A8)                               // CrySystem CryMalloc export
4. anim = C_CombatAnimAction_ctor(mem, mem, combatActor, /*priority*/5,
                                  fragmentID, tags20, /*flags*/0)   // CombatModule 0xF26F0
5. ++*(int*)(anim + 0x58)                               // AddRef (QueueAction consumes one)
6. _smart_ptr<C_CombatAnimAction> sp = anim            // an 8-byte stack slot holding anim
7. manager = *(void**)(combatActor + 0x490)            // C_CombatAnimActionManager
8. C_CombatAnimActionManager_QueueAction(manager, &sp, -1.0f)   // CombatModule 0xF3C00, time in XMM2
```

- **The float in XMM2 is the classic trap** (WO-42 §2.3): the third argument is
  a `float` in XMM2, value `-1.0f` (`0xBF800000`), *not* an int/pointer in R8.
- **Confidence: medium.** A `C_CombatAnimAction` is the correct combat action
  type and carries the lifecycle delegate *slots* — but this route does **not**
  run `C_CombatActorActionAttack::EnterImpl`'s pre-roll (WO-42 §5.2 steps 4-5,
  10-11) and does not *install* the delegates (the ctor only zeroes their slots;
  `EnterImpl` binds `OnAnimEntered`/`OnAnimFinished` into them). So rung 2 may
  render *more* of the swing than a bare `TAction` but may still not complete it.
  It is the cheapest experiment; run it first and observe.

### Rung 3 — construct a `C_CombatActorActionAttack` and let the game's own `EnterImpl` drive it

Highest fidelity, because the game does the orchestration end-to-end. Hand a
constructed attack action to the actor's own `C_ActionDirector` via
`C_ActionDirector::SetAction`; the director enters it and *its* `EnterImpl`
(CombatModule `0x44300`) runs the full WO-42 §5.2 sequence.

```
1. combatActor = GetOrCreateCombatActor(actor)
2. mem = CryMalloc(0xC0)                                // sizeof C_CombatActorActionAttack (WO-42 §4.3)
3. attack = MakeAttack(mem, combatActor, descriptor)   // CombatModule factory 0x84D20
4. director = *(void**)(combatActor + 0x2E0)           // wh::framework::C_ActionDirector*
5. C_ActionDirector::SetAction(director, &attack)      // imported symbol; enters it -> EnterImpl runs
```

- **The one open runtime unknown (WO-42 §9.4 rung-2 note):** step 3 needs a
  valid **attack descriptor pointer** (`S_CombatActorActionAttackParams`, stored
  at `attack+0x60`). The *data* is shipped, enumerable XML — WO-42 §9.1/§9.2:
  every one of the 470 shipped sync-attacks (and 221 unpaired attacks) is a row
  in `combat_action_attack.xml` / `combat_action_sync_attack.xml`, each carrying
  `mn_fragment_id` + `mn_tags` + timings, and each sync-attack has its
  `combat_fragment_meta.xml` metadata row (so rung 3 is **not** data-gated). What
  is not yet in hand is the *runtime pointer* to a loaded descriptor row. The
  attack-selection code (`I_CombatActor + 0x478`/`+0x4D8`, WO-42 §4.4) is where
  the game gets one; a future session should trace that to a lookup that takes a
  fragment ID or descriptor key. **This is the real remaining research item for
  direction B, and it is bounded.**
- **`SetAction` on a ghost is the second unknown** (WO-42 §8): whether
  `C_ActionDirector::SetAction` accepts a puppeted-ghost actor as it does a real
  brained combatant. The §6 probe confirms the director pointer resolves; only a
  live run confirms `SetAction` succeeds.

### The parse (both rungs need `(fragmentID, TagState)` from `"FragmentId, tags"`)

The engine already does this; do not hand-compute Mannequin IDs. Two confirmed
sources:

- **AnimationModule `ParseFragmentSpec`, RVA `0x12DB00`** (WO-42 §6.1): given the
  actor's animation database and the string `"FragmentId, tag1+tag2"`, yields
  `fragmentID` + the 20-byte `TagState` directly. The cleanest option.
- **Replicate `0xAE17A0`'s own inline parse** (§1 steps 1-2, now fully
  decompiled): CRC32-lower the name, look it up in the action controller's
  context fragment table (`FUN_180123CB0`); then split tags on `+`, CRC32-lower
  each, look up in the tag-definition table, set the `TagState` bits. More code,
  but self-contained and proven (the fragment *does* start playing under rung 1,
  so this parse is already known-correct).

---

## 6. What was built this session — `native/KCDMP/combat_construct.cpp` (new file)

A **precondition probe**, not a constructor. It resolves the ghost's
`I_CombatActor*` and logs every pointer/offset rung 2 and rung 3 consume, so the
next session can confirm the route's inputs resolve on a live ghost *before* any
allocation or queue. It is the direct analogue of WO-43's `combat_playanim.cpp`:
same conventions (PE export prefix-resolution via `pe_exports.h`; every raw
dereference in its own tiny SEH-guarded helper with no destructible locals, per
the MSVC C2712 trap WO-43 documented; the opt-in trigger-file pattern).

**Everything it does is a read or an idempotent engine call the game itself
makes routinely** — it constructs nothing and queues nothing. The one non-read is
`GetOrCreateCombatActor` (only in `create` mode), which the engine calls whenever
combat begins; it creates the combat actor if the ghost has none yet, which is a
*precondition* for a swing, not a mutation of game state.

**Trigger (opt-in, matching `kcdmp-faction.txt` / `kcdmp-playanim.txt`):**
`kcdmp-combat.txt` beside the deployed `KCDMP.dll`. Absent = skip entirely.

```
line 1: player            (or a decimal CryEngine entity id -- the ghost's,
                           obtainable live via the mp_entity_id console command
                           WO-43 added to kdcmp.lua)
line 2: probe             (default -- raw read of actor+0x300, zero mutation)
        create            (call GetOrCreateCombatActor if the ghost has no
                           combat actor yet)
```

It logs, each `describe()`d as `module+0xRVA` (WO-43's idiom):

1. the resolved `C_Actor*`;
2. **the actor's vptr, and whether it equals `C_Player::vftable`
   (EntityModule `0xE96F78`)** — this settles §2's live question directly;
3. `GetName()` (a cheap sanity read);
4. `actor->vtbl[0x988]()` combat-capability;
5. `actor+0x300` (`m_pCombatActor`) raw; and, in `create` mode, the
   `GetOrCreateCombatActor` result;
6. off the `I_CombatActor`: `+0x2D8` (owning entity — with a **round-trip
   assertion that it equals the `C_Actor` we started from**), `+0x2E0`
   (`C_ActionDirector`, rung-3's `SetAction` target), `+0x490`
   (`C_CombatAnimActionManager`, rung-2's queue target), `+0x2F0` (combat state
   block) and `state+0x1118` (**current opponent** — present ⇒ rung-3 paired
   route viable; absent ⇒ rung-2 unpaired still fine).

Wired into `dllmain.cpp` immediately after `probe_play_anim()` in the existing
startup `run_sync` block, and into `CMakeLists.txt`. **Built clean**
(`native/Build-Native.ps1`, Release): `KCDMP.dll`, **289,280 bytes**, zero
errors, zero new warnings.

### 6.1 Live-test run sheet (for a future session with a human at the machine)

The method is WO-43 §5/§7's, which worked: drive the game via
`localhost:1403/api/System/Console/ExecuteString` from the coding shell, read
`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\KCD2Mod\kcd.log` directly (never
`%LocalAppData%\KCDMP` — sandboxed for this shell), and spawn ghosts under
**fresh, never-reused ids** (WO-43 §6: reused ids corrupt the ghost). First
confirm the game is up: `curl http://localhost:1403/api/rpg/Calendar?depth=1`.

The probe fires once at DLL attach, so `kcdmp-combat.txt` must be in place
*before* launch. Because the probe reads the trigger once at attach, testing a
ghost means: get the ghost's entity id from a *previous* run (or the
`mp_entity_id <name>` console command), write it into `kcdmp-combat.txt`, then
relaunch. (A future iteration could move the probe behind a pipe command to
avoid the relaunch; out of scope here.)

**Test A — the player, read-only (proves the mechanism end-to-end, zero risk):**

`kcdmp-combat.txt`:
```
player
probe
```
Launch, load a save, then read `kcd.log` / `kcdmp-native.log` for `COMBAT:` lines.

**Test B — the player, create mode (proves the combat-actor path):**
```
player
create
```

**Test C — a ghost (the real target):** get a ghost's entity id, then
`kcdmp-combat.txt`:
```
<ghost entity id>
create
```

**Outcome → verdict table:**

| `kcd.log` shows | verdict |
|---|---|
| `actor vptr ... IS C_Player` | ghost is C_Player-layout — explains why `PlayAnim`/`+0xE48` rendered on it (§2 resolved) |
| `actor vptr ... NOT C_Player's vtable` | ghost is another class; the `module+0xRVA` in the line identifies it — hand that RVA to a Ghidra pass to name it and find its real PlayAnim slot |
| `combat-capable = 0` | this actor cannot host a combat action at all — rung 2/3 are impossible on it; investigate why the ghost isn't combat-capable |
| `m_pCombatActor (raw) = null` in `probe` mode, then non-null after `create` | expected for a ghost not in combat; `create` is the right mode for rung 2/3 |
| `combatActor+0x490 (...manager...) = <non-null, CombatModule+0xRVA>` | **rung-2 queue target confirmed live** — proceed to implement rung 2 |
| `combatActor+0x2E0 (C_ActionDirector) = <non-null>` | **rung-3 SetAction target confirmed live** |
| `combatActor+0x2D8 ... MATCH (round-trip ok)` | the `I_CombatActor ↔ C_Actor` offset pair is correct on this live object — the whole offset map is trustworthy for this build |
| `state+0x1118 (current opponent) = <non-null>` | ghost has a live opponent — rung-3 paired route is viable; else use rung-2 unpaired |
| any `... faulted` line | that specific offset/call is wrong for this actor on this build — do **not** proceed to construction until it reads clean; report the faulting line |

Nothing in any of these paths constructs or queues an action, so no test here can
produce (or fail to produce) a swing. The probe's job is only to prove the inputs
are all present and correct before the next session writes the construction code
from §5.

---

## 7. How this session ran (reproduction)

WO-42's three Ghidra projects **survived** in the prior session's scratchpad and
were reused as-is (no re-import, ~9 min saved each):

```
<prior scratch>\gproj\wo42.gpr    -> AnimationModule.dll
<prior scratch>\gproj2\wo42c.gpr  -> CombatModule.dll
<prior scratch>\gproj3\wo42e.gpr  -> EntityModule.dll
```

(Found via a recursive `*.gpr` search under the temp tree; the imported program
data is intact — `EntityModule.dll` ~843 MB of analysis in `gproj3`.) Ghidra
`12.1.3` and Temurin JDK 21 are at the paths WO-42 §7.1 records. The WO-42
scripts (`native/ghidra_scripts/DumpWo42{Fns,Asm,Callers,Vtbl,Anchors}.java`)
ran unchanged; this session added one small helper,
**`native/ghidra_scripts/DumpWo44Owner.java`** — given a raw slot address, it
walks back to the nearest `vftable` symbol and reports the slot's byte offset,
which is what identified `0xAE17A0` as C_Player `+0xE48` and unmasked the four
`.pdata` false refs.

Representative command (re-run `0xAE17A0` against the surviving project):

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot"
$g    = "C:\Users\Jonasty\Downloads\ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC_20260817\ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC"
& "$g\support\analyzeHeadless.bat" <prior scratch>\gproj3 wo42e `
    -process "EntityModule.dll" -noanalysis `
    -scriptPath "native\ghidra_scripts" `
    -postScript DumpWo42Fns.java "<out>\ae17a0.txt" 1 0x180AE17A0
```

If the projects are ever gone, WO-42 §7.1 re-imports all three in ~10 min each.
Every RVA here is valid only for the binaries WO-42 §1 fingerprints (Modding
Tools 1.5.5.0, `ReleaseSteamLTO_DLL` build 1166656_117; `EntityModule.dll`
20,977,664 bytes, confirmed this session).

---

## 8. Where solid ground ends

**Observed (read from the disassembly this session):** `0xAE17A0` builds a bare
`0x90` `TAction<SAnimationContext>` (via the RTTI-labelled TAction ctor
`0x121300`) and queues it via `IActionController::Queue` (+0x98) — §1; the
`C_Player` vtable identification and the fact `0xAE17A0` sits in no other vtable
— §2; the shorter `C_Human`/`C_NPCActor` primary vtables — §2; the re-verified
`GetOrCreateCombatActor` (`0x92260`), `C_CombatAnimAction` ctor (`0xF26F0`) and
`C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction` (`0xF3C00`) — §4; the `C_ScriptBindHuman::PlayAnim`
guard+call at `+0xE48` — §2.

**Read-but-unrendered (traced, never executed):** the mechanism in §3 (that the
missing combat state machine is *why* the fragment holds); all of §5's
construction (nothing was built or queued this session); whether rung 2 alone
completes a swing; whether `SetAction` accepts a ghost.

**Inferred, labelled:** the swing-vs-jump reasoning in §3 (a reading over three
observed facts, not a fourth observation); the claim that WO-43's ghosts were
`C_Player`-layout (consistent with all evidence but not yet directly observed —
the §6 probe is written specifically to confirm it).

**Deliberately not done:** no game launched, no process touched, no combat action
constructed or queued, no `VERSION` change, no Mannequin data modified. Licensing
posture unchanged — WO-42's binaries this machine already owns, read statically.

---

## 9. Handoff

- **Direction A is closed by decompilation** — rung 1 (`PlayAnim`/`+0xE48`) is a
  bare-fragment player and cannot complete a combat swing; do not re-attempt it,
  and do not look for a "one more precondition" fix (there is no branch to enable).
- **Direction B is the path**, and its entry points are re-verified (§4). The
  next session, with a human at the machine, should:
  1. Run the §6 probe (Tests A→C) to confirm the ghost has a combat actor and
     that the manager/director/opponent offsets resolve live, and to settle the
     ghost's class (§2). This is safe and needs no new code.
  2. Implement **rung 2** (§5) as the cheapest experiment — build a
     `C_CombatAnimAction`, queue via the actor's manager — and observe whether it
     completes the swing.
  3. If rung 2 is still partial, implement **rung 3** (§5) — construct a
     `C_CombatActorActionAttack` and hand it to the actor's `C_ActionDirector`
     via `SetAction`, resolving the one remaining open item: the **runtime attack
     descriptor pointer** (trace the attack-selection path off
     `I_CombatActor+0x478`/`+0x4D8`, WO-42 §4.4).
- The two orthogonal bugs WO-43 §6 flagged (console argument parsing, ghost
  respawn corruption under reused ids) remain real and out of scope; flagged
  again so they aren't lost.
