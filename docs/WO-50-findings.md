# WO-50 — research for main-release polish: Discord presence, HUD cleanup, launcher icon

Worked 2026-08-24 (Sonnet 5). Started research-only per the session brief;
the human asked for the icon and Discord presence to be built the same
session once the specs below existed. **Phase 1 and Phase 3 are now
implemented and live-verified. Phase 2 remains a spec, not yet built.**
See "Session 2 — implementation" at the end of this document for what
actually shipped and what was learned building it that the original spec
below did not (and could not) anticipate.

`docs/branding/kcd2-mp-logo.png` committed — copied from the human-provided
`docs/branding/npp_kcd_mp_color.png` (2048×2048, 8-bit RGBA, real alpha,
confirmed via `file`).

## Phase 1 — Discord Rich Presence

### 1. Discord Application: does not exist yet — human action required

Searched the repo for any registered Client ID, asset key, or Discord
Developer Portal reference. Found none. The only existing Discord footprint
is a community server invite (`discord.gg/m4U95xUZ5`, `docs/WO-19-progress.md`,
`README.md`) wired to the launcher's REPORT BUG button
(`KCDMP_launcher/Components/Shared/UrlLauncher.cs`) — unrelated to a Rich
Presence application. **Confirmed absent, not assumed.**

**What the human needs to do, before a build WO can start:**
1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal, create a new Application (any name,
   e.g. "KCD2 Multiplayer"), and copy its **Application ID** (this is the
   Rich Presence "Client ID").
2. Inside that application, open **Rich Presence → Art Assets**, click
   **Add Asset**, upload `docs/branding/kcd2-mp-logo.png`, and give it a
   **Key** (e.g. `logo`). Images should be ≥512×512 (1024×1024 recommended);
   the 2048×2048 source clears that easily. Assets are usually available
   within minutes, occasionally up to a few hours.
3. Hand over: **Client ID** + **asset key** (e.g. `logo`). Nothing else is
   needed — basic Rich Presence (status text + one large image) does not
   require Discord app review/verification, unlike features such as
   Ask-to-Join or Spectate.

### 2. Library: `DiscordRichPresence` (Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) — confirmed current

Searched NuGet directly rather than trusting memory. Latest version
**1.6.1.70, published 2025-08-04** (~1 year before this session, reasonable
for a small, stable API surface). 6.6M total downloads, MIT licensed,
targets **.NET 9.0**, .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET Framework 4.5+. This is the
de facto standard unofficial C# implementation of Discord's classic
IPC-based Rich Presence protocol — not the newer "Discord Social SDK" (a
larger, separate API for deeper social features like invites/friends that
this task does not need).

### 3. Owning process: the agent (`KcdMp.Client`), not the launcher — confirmed from code, not assumed

Read `KCDMP_launcher/Pages/Home.razor.cs`'s `ConnectToGame()`: once the agent
starts, the UI literally displays **"Connected. You can close this once
you're playing."** (line 656). And `ConfirmExit()` (the launcher's own quit
handler, line 1209) calls `StopHostedRelay()` and `StopHostedMasterServer()`
but **never** stops `agentProcess`. So the launcher is explicitly designed
to be closable mid-session, while the agent (`KcdMp.Client.exe`,
`dotnet/KcdMp.Client/Program.cs`) is the process that persists for the
actual play session — it owns the relay connection (`GameBridge.RunAsync`)
and lives until the player quits the game or the agent itself. Presence
belongs on the agent.

**Consequence:** the launcher and agent are separate .NET executables
(`KCDMP_launcher.csproj` vs `KcdMp.Client.csproj`), so the Discord IPC
connection, the `PackageReference`, and the update loop all belong in
`dotnet/KcdMp.Client/`, most naturally as a new class alongside
`GameBridge.cs`.

### 4. Implementation spec

**State to show:**
- `Details`: `"Hosting"` or `"Playing"` (joined) — see the caveat below.
- `State`: mod version, from the already-existing `ReleaseVersionInfo.Current`
  (`dotnet/KcdMp.Client/ReleaseVersionInfo.cs`) — free, no new plumbing.
  Optionally append peer count once connected (see below).
- `LargeImageKey`: the asset key handed over in step 1.2 above.
- `StartTimestamp`: set once, at agent startup, so Discord shows elapsed
  session time ("00:14 elapsed").

**Hosting vs. joined — flagged, not solved:** `ClientConfig`
(`dotnet/KcdMp.Client/ClientConfig.cs`) has no `IsHosting` concept; the agent
always just connects to `ServerHost:ServerPort` like any client, whether or
not that relay happens to be one the launcher spawned locally
(`hostedRelayProcess` in `Home.razor.cs`). The launcher *does* know which
case it is. Cleanest fix: launcher passes a new flag (e.g. `--hosting`) on
the existing agent command line (`ConnectToGame`'s `agentArgs`, line 641)
when it also started `hostedRelayProcess`; the agent just threads it through
to the presence text. Don't infer it from `ServerHost == "localhost"` — a
host on a LAN address would misclassify.

**Peer count:** available cheaply from `_ghostReleaseVersions` (or the
equivalent live ghost-id set) in `GameBridge.cs` — it already grows/shrinks
as peers connect/disconnect (`ReleaseVersion` packet, `0x1E`).

**Update triggers:**
- On agent startup (after config load, before `RunAsync`): initialize Discord
  RPC, set initial presence (`Details = "Connecting..."`).
- On relay connect (`ConnectAndRunAsync`, after the TCP connect succeeds):
  update to `Hosting`/`Playing` + version.
- On a peer's `ReleaseVersion` packet arriving/leaving: update peer count.
- On disconnect/shutdown (the existing `ProcessExit`/`CancelKeyPress`
  handlers in `Program.cs`): call `Dispose()` on the RPC client so the
  presence clears instead of sticking on a stale state after the agent
  exits.

**What the human must hand over before this can be built:** Client ID +
asset key (step 1 above). Nothing else blocks implementation once those two
values exist.

## Phase 2 — hide the debug HUD overlay for release builds

### 1. CVar identified and live-verified: `r_DisplayInfo`

Live-tested against the running Modding Tools build over the project's
standard debug REST API (`localhost:1403/api/System/Console/...`, the same
one every prior WO's probes use — see `tools/KcdApi.ps1`, `docs/kcd2_lua_api.md`):

```
GET /api/System/Console/GetCvarValue?name=r_DisplayInfo   → "3"   (default, on)
GET /api/System/Console/ExecuteString?command=r_DisplayInfo%200   → set to 0
GET /api/System/Console/GetCvarValue?name=r_DisplayInfo   → "0"   (confirmed)
```

**Human visually confirmed** (session live, game running, connected): with
`r_DisplayInfo=0` the build/memory/FPS corner block disappeared; the
ping/network indicator stayed visible. Restored to `3` afterward — readback
confirmed. This is the standard CryEngine debug-info overlay CVar (0=off,
1–3=increasing detail); nothing here is guessed from general engine
knowledge without the live round-trip above.

### 2. Confirmed separate from the ping/network indicator — different systems entirely

Not just "a different setting" — a **different rendering mechanism**. The
ping indicator is the **mod's own Lua code**, not an engine overlay:

```lua
-- kdcmp/Data/Scripts/Startup/kdcmp.lua:3490-3493
if KCD2MP.pingText then
    System.DrawText(10, 10, KCD2MP.pingText, 2)
end
```

(`KCD2MP_ShowPing`, line 124, sets `KCD2MP.pingText` from the agent's
measured latency.) `r_DisplayInfo` cannot affect it because it isn't an
engine-drawn element at all — it's the mod calling `System.DrawText` every
frame, same mechanism documented in memory ([[kcd2-lua-drawing-limits]]) as
the only screen-draw call that actually renders. Live test confirmed this
plainly: toggling `r_DisplayInfo` never touched the ping line.

### 3. Mechanism for off-by-default-but-toggleable: mod-side `System.SetCVar`, not an engine config file

This project already has the right tool for exactly this, live in
`kdcmp.lua`, and already used for an equivalent problem
(`KCD2MP.dice.requireTable`, flipped by `mp_dice_gate on|off`,
line ~1624). The Lua API doc (`docs/kcd2_lua_api.md:14-15`) confirms
`System.SetCVar(name, value)` / `System.GetCVarValue(name)` are real,
callable bindings — not the external REST-only surface, callable directly
from the mod's own script.

**The concrete mechanism:** add near `MOD INIT`
(`kdcmp/Data/Scripts/Startup/kdcmp.lua:1-2`), gated by a flag so a future
debug session can flip it without editing code:

```lua
KCD2MP.debugHud = false   -- release default: OFF
if not KCD2MP.debugHud then
    System.SetCVar("r_DisplayInfo", "0")
end
```

Plus a console command mirroring the existing `mp_dice_gate`/
`mp_enable_aggro` pattern (`System.AddCCommand`, registered alongside the
other `mp_*` commands around line 6642):

```lua
System.AddCCommand("mp_debug_hud", "KCD2MP_DebugHud('%LINE')", "on|off: toggle the CryEngine debug HUD (r_DisplayInfo) without a rebuild")
```

This is a **mod-side** override, reasserted every time `kdcmp.lua` loads —
it does not touch the base game's own `system.cfg`/`autoexec.cfg` (found no
existing mechanism there; the mod doesn't currently write engine config
files at all, and shouldn't start here). It survives a player's own engine
config regardless of what CryEngine or Modding Tools shipped as the
built-in default, and it is trivially reversible for debugging by running
`mp_debug_hud on` from the console — no rebuild, matching the existing
`mp_dice_gate` convention exactly.

No human action needed for this phase — everything is mod-code, ships in
the pak like every other WO's Lua change.

---

## Phase 3 — new launcher icon

### 1. Where the icon is set today — confirmed empty

- `KCDMP_launcher/KCDMP_launcher.csproj` has **no `<ApplicationIcon>`
  property at all** — the launcher currently ships with the .NET SDK's
  generic default exe icon.
- `installer/KCDMP.iss`'s `[Icons]` section (Start Menu shortcut, desktop
  shortcut) sets `Filename: "{app}\{#AppExeName}"` with **no
  `IconFilename` override** — both shortcuts read whatever icon is embedded
  in `KCDMP_launcher.exe` itself. **One change point, not two**: fix the
  exe's own icon and both shortcuts inherit it automatically. No installer
  script edit needed.

### 2. Conversion path: real multi-resolution `.ico`, two viable options — confirmed, neither installed here

Checked this machine: no ImageMagick (`magick`/`convert` — the only
`convert.exe` found is Windows' own unrelated file-system conversion
utility), no Python. `KCDMP_launcher.csproj` already sets
`<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>`, which pulls in
`System.Drawing.Common` for free — no new package needed for option B.

**Option A — ImageMagick** (industry-standard, most reliable, one command):
```
magick docs/branding/kcd2-mp-logo.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 KCDMP_launcher/app.ico
```
Requires installing ImageMagick first (`winget install ImageMagick.ImageMagick`)
— a one-time tool install, not attempted this session since this WO builds
nothing.

**Option B — small in-repo conversion helper, zero new dependencies:** a
short C# console snippet using `System.Drawing.Bitmap` to resize the source
to each target size (256/128/64/48/32/16 px) and encode each as PNG, then
hand-write the standard Vista+ `.ico` container (`ICONDIR` header +
`ICONDIRENTRY` array + PNG-compressed image data per entry — a well
documented ~50-line binary format, not a guess). Avoids installing anything
new; slightly more code to write and verify once.

Either produces a real multi-resolution `.ico` — a single upscaled 256px
image renamed `.ico` (the failure mode explicitly flagged in the brief) is
not proposed by either option.

### 3. Concrete spec

**Files to change:**
- Add `KCDMP_launcher/app.ico` (or similar), built from
  `docs/branding/kcd2-mp-logo.png` via Option A or B above.
- `KCDMP_launcher/KCDMP_launcher.csproj`: add
  `<ApplicationIcon>app.ico</ApplicationIcon>` inside the existing top
  `<PropertyGroup>`. Covers the exe's file icon — Explorer, Start Menu
  shortcut, desktop shortcut, taskbar icon **when the app is not running**.
- `KCDMP_launcher/Program.cs`: add a `MainWindow.SetIconFile("app.ico")`
  call in the existing `MainWindow` chain (next to `SetTitle`/`SetSize`,
  line ~56-62). Photino's window icon is a **separate** setting from the
  exe's embedded resource — needed for the title bar and the taskbar icon
  **while the app is running**.

**Known residual risk, flagged rather than papered over:** an
open/unresolved Photino.NET issue
([tryphotino/photino.NET#106](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.NET/issues/106))
reports that on Windows 11, even with both `ApplicationIcon` and
`IconFile`/`SetIconFile` set correctly, the **running window's taskbar
icon** can still fall back to a generic icon (the title bar icon works).
No confirmed workaround exists upstream as of this search. Do both settings
anyway — they're the only levers that exist and they fix the file-icon
cases unconditionally — but the build WO should visually check the taskbar
specifically after a real install, not assume it's fixed by the code
change alone.

**Nothing else needs a separate change:** confirmed no `IconFilename`
override in `KCDMP.iss`, no icon handling in `tools/Publish-Release.ps1`,
and no other launcher-facing executable (agent, relay, injector) ships a
visible icon anywhere a user would see it.

---

## Session 2 — implementation (same day)

The human asked for the icon to be fixed and the Discord Client ID
walkthrough to happen this same session, then supplied the Client ID
(`1541566715140243506`) and, after upload, the Rich Presence asset key
(`kcd_mp_color_2`). Both features below were built, and the taskbar-icon
question above is now a real, live-checked answer, not a guess.

### Phase 3, built: launcher icon

- `tools/Build-LauncherIcon.ps1` — new. Resizes the source PNG to
  16/32/48/64/128/256px and hand-writes a real multi-resolution `.ico`
  (Vista+ PNG-compressed entries), zero new dependency
  (`System.Drawing.Common` already comes in via `UseWindowsForms`).
  Re-run any time the source art changes.
- `KCDMP_launcher/app.ico` — generated output, committed.
- `KCDMP_launcher/KCDMP_launcher.csproj` — added `<ApplicationIcon>app.ico
  </ApplicationIcon>` plus a `None`/`CopyToOutputDirectory` item so the raw
  file ships beside the exe (the embedded resource alone isn't enough —
  see next line).
- `KCDMP_launcher/Program.cs` — added `app.MainWindow.SetIconFile("app.ico")`
  next to the existing `SetTitle`/`SetSize` chain, for Photino's own
  runtime window/taskbar icon.
- **Verified, not assumed:** built the project, extracted the compiled
  exe's actual embedded icon via `System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon`
  and confirmed pixel-for-pixel it's the new logo, not the SDK default.
  The taskbar-icon risk flagged in the research section above (open
  Photino.NET issue #106) was **not** separately re-verified live in this
  session — that still needs an eyes-on check after a real install.

### Phase 1, built: Discord Rich Presence in the agent

New `dotnet/KcdMp.Client/DiscordPresence.cs`, `PackageReference` on
`DiscordRichPresence` 1.6.1.70. Wired into `GameBridge.cs`: one instance
per agent process (survives relay reconnects), `SetConnected(isHosting)`
on a successful handshake, `SetPeerCount(...)` refreshed off the existing
`_peerLastSeenUtc` 2-minute liveness window (same one `hasLivePeers`
already used — reused, not invented) on every Ghost/Disconnect packet
(cheap: it no-ops unless the count actually changed), `ResetForReconnect()`
in the existing post-disconnect cleanup block, and `Dispose()` in
`RunAsync`'s `finally`. `ClientConfig` gained `DiscordPresenceEnabled`,
`DiscordClientId` (defaults to the real App ID — not a secret, it's the
public identifier Discord's own client uses), `DiscordLargeImageKey`
(defaults to `kcd_mp_color_2`), and `IsHosting`; `--discord`/`--no-discord`/
`--hosting` command-line flags mirror the existing `--voice` pattern.
`Home.razor.cs`'s `ConnectToGame` now passes `--hosting` when
`hostedRelayProcess` is alive at that point — set by `OpenHostModal` before
`LaunchAsHost` ever reaches `ConnectToGame`, so it's a reliable signal
(`ServerHost`/IP alone is not: a LAN host address looks identical to a
joiner pointed at the same address).

**A real bug found and fixed, not guessed at:** a smoke-tested run threw
```
System.NullReferenceException at DiscordRPC.Assets.Merge(Assets other)
```
on Discord's own ready-handshake round-trip. Pulled the actual source at
the exact installed tag (`v1.6.1`, matching NuGet `1.6.1.70`) and confirmed
`Assets.Merge` calls `other._smallimagekey.StartsWith(...)` with **no null
guard** — fixed later upstream (the null-check exists on `master`/`v1.6.2`)
but never republished to NuGet, so the *currently-shipping* "actively
maintained" package still carries it. The library's own internal catch
logs it and keeps running (confirmed: the agent process never crashed,
kept ticking normally past it) — but rather than rely on that, `Assets` in
`DiscordPresence.cs` now always sets `SmallImageKey = ""` explicitly, since
leaving it at its C# default (`null`) is the concrete trigger path for any
presence that (like this one) has a large image but no small image.

**Live-verified end-to-end**, not just "compiles": ran the built agent
directly against a bogus relay (isolates Discord from the full
game+relay stack), watched it log `Initialize() returned True`,
`OnReady` firing with the real logged-in Discord username, and
`SetPresence` being called with the exact configured details/state/image
key. Human confirmed by screenshot: Discord showed **"Playing — KCD2
Multiplayer — Connecting... — v0.16.8 · solo"** with the logo and a live
elapsed-time counter, exactly matching the code. It later appeared to
"revert" to Discord's own auto-detected "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II
Modding Tools" line — traced to the smoke test's own `timeout` command
killing the process, which is the **correct** behavior (presence should
clear when the agent exits), not a bug.

**One human-side gotcha surfaced and worth remembering:** Discord has two
separate, independently-toggled settings — "Display currently running
game as a status message" (governs the auto-detected line) and "Display
current activity as a status message" (Settings → Activity Privacy —
governs custom Rich Presence from apps like this one). Confirming the
second one is on was part of getting to the working screenshot above; a
future tester whose presence never shows should be pointed at that
setting before assuming the code is broken.

Farkle suite re-run after these changes: 59/59 PASS, unaffected.

**Follow-up on "it reverted" (same day, second report):** the human later
saw Discord fall back to "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Modding Tools" a
second time and asked about it. Checked directly rather than guessing:
`tasklist` showed no `KingdomCome.exe` process and `localhost:1403`
refused the connection — **neither the game nor the agent was running at
that moment.** The auto-detected game line Discord was showing was
already stale (the game itself had also closed); this is Discord's own
UI lagging behind reality, not something either this feature or this
project's code controls. No agent process, no custom presence — exactly
the designed behavior, not a regression.

### Phase 2, built (session 3): HUD CVar release-off

`kdcmp/Data/Scripts/Startup/kdcmp.lua`: `KCD2MP.debugHud = false` right
after `KCD2MP = {}` at MOD INIT, calling `System.SetCVar("r_DisplayInfo",
"0")` when off (the release default). `KCD2MP_DebugHud(arg)` mirrors the
existing `KCD2MP_EnableAggro`'s on/off shape exactly, and is registered as
`mp_debug_hud on|off` alongside the other `mp_*` commands — flips
`r_DisplayInfo` back to `3` live, no rebuild, for a future debugging
session. Matches the spec above exactly: mod-side override, not an engine
config file; independent of the ping indicator (untouched by any of this).

Rebuilt and deployed via `tools\Build-And-Install-Mod.ps1` (game confirmed
not running first: no `KingdomCome.exe` process, `localhost:1403`
refused). Not re-verified live in-session (would need a fresh game
launch + save load) — the Phase 2 research section above already
live-verified the underlying CVar and its independence from the ping
indicator; this session only added the mod-side gating code around a
fact already confirmed true.

### VERSION

Bumped `0.16.8` → `0.17.0` for this WO's combined work (Discord presence,
launcher icon, HUD default), on the human's own explicit instruction —
see `docs/VERSIONING.md`. `release\KCDMP-Setup-0.17.0.exe` was built the
same day via `tools\Build-Installer.ps1` (95.7 MB, clean compile,
1022-file manifest); uploading/distributing it remains the human's call.

### Real-install follow-up: "Discord stuck on Modding Tools" (session 4)

Reported again after installing and running the actual `0.17.0` build —
this time with the real game AND the real agent running together for the
first time (every earlier check had only one of the two, or neither).
Read the real installed `agent.log`
(`%LocalAppData%\KCDMP\agent.log`) rather than re-guessing: it logged the
identical correct sequence as the working screenshot —
`Initialize() returned True`, `OnReady` with the real Discord username,
then `SetPresence` for both `"Connecting..."` and `"Hosting"` carrying
the right version and image key. The known `Assets.Merge` NRE (see
above) fired twice, same as always, still non-fatal. **The code is
confirmed doing exactly what it should; the open variable was Discord's
own handling of two simultaneous activities** (its own auto-detected
game plus a custom RPC from a different Application ID) in the compact
status view versus the full profile card. Human checked and confirmed:
**it is working correctly.** No code change was needed. Worth remembering
for a future report of the same shape: check `agent.log` for the
`[discord]` lines before assuming the feature is broken — the first two
"stuck" reports in this WO both turned out to be either nothing running
at all, or Discord's own display, never the agent's code.

**The actual trigger, pinned down by the human:** Discord's compact
status only swaps from the auto-detected game to the custom presence
after an Alt+Tab away from the game (i.e. once Discord's own client
window regains focus/redraws) *and* the agent has actually reached
`SetConnected` — in practice, right when the player Alt+Tabs back to
check and hits **Connect**. The human's call, and a reasonable one: this
is a **feature, not a bug** — it doubles as a visible, free confirmation
that the agent is actually connected, with no extra code needed to
produce it. Nothing to fix.
