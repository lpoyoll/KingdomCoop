# WO-6 progress log

Append-only. Newest entry at the bottom. If you are starting a new session,
read this file plus `docs/SESSION-PROMPT-wo6-native-dice.md` (what this WO
was asked to do) and, if picking up the in-game overlay work specifically,
`docs/SESSION-PROMPT-wo6-overlay-ui.md` (what to do next — a design pivot
happened at the end of this session, see below).

---

## Session 1 — 2026-07-28 — Phase 0.5, R0, R1, R2, and a design pivot

Started cold from `docs/SESSION-PROMPT-wo6-native-dice.md`. Did not reach
Phase 1/2 builds — R2 turned out to need far more investigation than
budgeted, and the session ended on a design pivot instead. Nothing here is
half-finished code; everything committed is either a completed research step
or a clean negative result with evidence.

### Housekeeping first

Found uncommitted changes from a prior session's verification pass already
in the working tree: a real bug fix (`Home.razor.cs`'s ping loop skipping
manually-added servers) and TEMP diagnostic logging left mid-investigation
in `DiceIpcClient.cs`. Committed the fix on its own, reverted the diagnostic
back to its original silent form. Also committed the prior session's raw
working documents (`VERIFICATION-REPORT.md`, `SESSION-SUMMARY-pre-final-wo.md`)
alongside the WO-6 session prompt itself.

### Phase 0.5 — licensing

Added `LICENSE` (GPLv3, fetched verbatim from gnu.org) and a "License and
Provenance" section to `README.md`. One clarification surfaced and resolved
with the human: GPL permits commercial resale of derivatives (copyleft means
derivatives must stay open, not that they can't be sold) — the human's actual
goal was closer to a non-commercial license, but chose GPLv3 anyway after
understanding the tradeoff, prioritizing dependency-compatibility and
staying aligned with "the fork will carry a GPL license" from the WO brief.

### R0 — framework/dependency scout

Searched Nexus/GitHub for existing native tooling. Found and evaluated:
`kcd2_rttr_dumper` (unlicensed, used as an unvendored local research
reference only — see below), `kcdx`/`KCSE-for-kcd2`/`KCD2ModLoader` (general
script-extender frameworks, declined — this project's own native plugin
already works and these would replace it rather than extend it),
`kcd2-modding-docs` (doesn't cover the dice/GUI surface, declined). Nothing
adopted as a dependency.

### R1 — mapping the reflected surface

**Static lead, before touching the game:** `kcd2_rttr_dumper`'s committed
57k-line static RTTR type dump led directly to `wh::guimodule::C_UIDice` —
a real reflected class with five methods (`ShowDiceScore` taking 14
parameters, `HideDiceScore`, `ShowDiceProperties`, `HideDiceProperties`,
`SetCurrentPlayer`) and zero properties.

**Live confirmation:** walked the debug REST API (`localhost:1403`) the same
way `NATIVE-PLUGIN-findings.md` did for `rpg`/`xgen`/`ent`. Confirmed
`C_UIDice` sits in `GUIModule.UIElements` (index 22) alongside the game's
other minigames (Pickpocketing, Shop, ShootingContest — same
one-singleton-per-minigame pattern) and is **genuinely empty even at
depth=4**, live, not just in the static dump.

**Environment correction, mid-session:** the human had launched via
`KCDMP_launcher` rather than the Modding Tools Steam entry directly. Debug
REST API unaffected (built into the game, independent of this mod's DLL).
`KCDMP.dll`'s *automatic* injection did hit the known 0-frames race
(`VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` Track 1) — manually re-injected a fresh copy into
the same already-running process, worked immediately (same fix already
verified last session). Automatic-injection race remains open, out of scope
here.

**Real game, real negative result:** played two real games against "Dicer
Filip." With known ground-truth scores mid-match (600/350 banked), searched
`C_UIDice`, `PlayerModule`, `PlayerSoul` (`CombatSoul` included),
`ent`/`concept`/`db`/`dialog`/`behavior`/`xgen` — neither value appears
anywhere. **Confirmed: pull-based reflection cannot see the dice minigame's
live state**, same shape as combat's already-solved outbound problem.
Evidence committed as `tools/dice-probe-*.xml`.

Side finding: `PlayerSoul`'s own internal `Name` is `"Dude"` in this build —
resolves the old "Dude decoy" note from `NATIVE-PLUGIN-findings.md` (not a
lookalike soul, the player's own soul).

### R2 — find the logical dice

**Found `wh::playermodule::C_Dice`** by cross-referencing `PlayerModule.dll`'s
export table (`dumpbin /exports`) against the static RTTR dump — a real
game-logic controller class the dump itself missed, confirmed via one
exported method: `SetPauseWorldTime(bool)`.

**Attempted an inline hook on `SetPauseWorldTime`**, with the human's
explicit go-ahead, to capture a live `C_Dice*` instance (no exported
accessor reaches one; nothing imports it via any checked module's IAT, so
the already-proven IAT-hook technique had no attachment point). Verified the
hook site was safe via `dumpbin /disasm` (13 bytes, four complete
instructions, no internal jumps/RIP-relative operands) before installing.
**Installed cleanly against the human's live game — no crash — but never
fired across two real transitions** (finishing an in-progress game, starting
a fresh one). Clean negative: `SetPauseWorldTime` is almost certainly not
part of ordinary NPC gambling.

**Brought in Ghidra** (12.1.2, official release) + Temurin JDK 21 (Ghidra
needs 17+, machine only had Java 8) to properly recover `rttr::array_range<T>`'s
ABI by decompilation — the same discipline already used for
`variant`/`argument`/`instance`, just with a real disassembler instead of
`dumpbin`. Ran headless auto-analysis against `CrySystem.dll`, wrote
`native/ghidra_scripts/DumpArrayRangeFuncs.java` to decompile
`get_methods`/`get_properties`. **Recovered the real layout**: hidden sret
buffer's first two 8-byte slots are a plain `{begin, end}` pointer pair into
a contiguous array of 8-byte elements, directly usable as `Method::data`/
`Property::data`. Built this into `rttr_abi.h`/`.cpp` and a new
`probe_dice_class()` that asks rttr directly, by name, for every
method/property `C_Dice` has — no guessing.

**Final result: `C_Dice` is not RTTR-registered at all.**
`get_by_name` resolves without faulting; `is_valid` is false. Clean,
trustworthy negative (same shape as this project's own negative-control
discipline). **This closes the entire reflection-based path for `C_Dice`
definitively** — the class is real but was never hooked up to the
introspection system this project has been using all night, so no amount
of further tooling can read it. Likely reading: `C_Dice` belongs to a
scripted/quest dice context, not the "walk up to any NPC and gamble"
interaction this project needs (the `dice_gameLevel`/`dice_betType`/
`SpokeWithDicePlayers`-shaped enums found earlier read like flowgraph glue
for exactly that different context).

**R-gate reached, early, for Tier III+ specifically**, per the WO's own
instruction to stop before building past Tier II. Full tier verdict is in
`docs/WO-6-native-dice-findings.md` §"R-gate: Tier verdict": R2 exhausted
this session without success; Tier I/II are fully unblocked and unaffected;
Tier III+ is not proven unreachable but nothing tried tonight reached it —
the next concrete lead (not pursued tonight) is decompiling the real caller
of `C_UIDice::ShowDiceScore` with the now-working Ghidra pipeline.

### The design pivot

Presented the tier verdict to the human plainly (no jargon, per their
request). Their response reframed the actual goal in a way that sidesteps
the whole native-reflection problem:

- **Restrict to PvP only, at real dice tables.** NPC games stay exactly as
  they are today, untouched, full native experience. Only two real players
  gambling together triggers this mod's own dice UI.
- **The UI must be in-game/on-screen, never the launcher window.** Their
  explicit complaint about WO-5's existing `DiceWindow.razor`: "clunky,
  boring, and appears in the LAUNCHER, and not in the game." The launcher
  should be a launcher, full stop.
- **Wants better visuals/animation than the existing plan's plain
  `DrawText` overlay**, but understands (after the tradeoff was explained)
  that real sprite/texture-based dice needs its own small research spike
  (has the GUI module's image-drawing surface ever been checked? — no,
  never examined, per `PROJECT-STATE.md` §5.1), separate from and much
  lower-risk than tonight's `C_Dice` investigation, since it's about
  drawing this mod's *own* data, not reading the game's hidden state.

This is, functionally, **Tier II** (the WO's own guaranteed floor) with two
refinements: gated to real tables + PvP only (rather than "invite
anywhere"), and explicitly positioned as the actual deliverable rather than
a fallback — no further native reflection work needed to build it.

**Nothing was implemented for this yet** — the human asked for a
documentation handoff instead, to pass to a fresh session. See
`docs/SESSION-PROMPT-wo6-overlay-ui.md`.

### State at end of session

- `KCDMP.dll` is injected and alive in the currently-running game (multiple
  research copies actually — `native/build/KCDMP_dice3/`,
  `native/build/KCDMP_diceclass/`, plus earlier `KCDMP_retry`/`KCDMP_retry2/`
  — all harmless duplicates from iterative re-injection during this session,
  gitignored, not part of the repo). None of this matters for a fresh
  session: the game will need re-launching and re-injecting from scratch
  next time regardless.
- Ghidra 12.1.2 and Temurin JDK 21 are installed locally (not part of this
  repo — official-source installs, large binaries). See
  `native/ghidra_scripts/README.md` for how to reuse the pipeline.
- All suites untouched this session (no relay/protocol/engine changes) —
  still exactly as green as WO-5 left them.
- Full technical evidence trail: `docs/WO-6-native-dice-findings.md`.

## Session 2 â€” 2026-07-29 â€” the visual capability answer, and the overlay built

Started cold from `docs/SESSION-PROMPT-wo6-overlay-ui.md` plus the human's
expanded brief ("every bell, every whistle"). Nothing in
`docs/WO-6-native-dice-findings.md` was reopened.

### The headline: the answer was already on this machine

Part A asked for open-web research into how KCD2 mods achieve custom visuals.
That was done (see `docs/WO-6-visual-capability.md`, Routes 4 and 5), but it is
not where the useful answer came from. Three local sources beat it outright:

1. **`Tools/modding/docs/script_bind/script_bind.zip`** â€” Warhorse's own
   generated Lua scriptbind reference, dated `script_bind_2025_01_14`, shipped
   inside the Modding Tools install this project has required since day one.
   5,014 pages of authoritative signatures. **Nobody on this project had ever
   opened it.** It is now the first place to look for any Lua API question.
2. **`Data/IPL_GameData.pak` â†’ `Libs/UI/`** â€” 28 `UIElements/*.xml` files, the
   live Flash UI definitions, including a full dice presentation API.
3. **Scriptbind registration strings inside the shipped DLLs** â€” ground truth for
   *this build*, which catches things the docs list but the binary does not
   register.

### What that produced

- **CryEngine's Flash UI system is fully intact and reachable from our Lua.**
  Confirmed live: `UIAction` is a table and `CallFunction`, `ShowElement`,
  `SetVariable`, `SetArray`, `SetPos`, `SetAlpha`, `SetScale`, `SetVisible`,
  `GotoAndPlay` and `RegisterElementListener` are all functions.
- **The game's HUD already exposes the dice presentation API we would have
  wanted to build**: `ShowDiceScore` (14 params), `AddDiceSelector(Id,X,Y,IsPlayer)`,
  `ShowDiceCursor`, `ShowDiceProperties` â€” plus `ShowTutorial` (HTML text),
  `ShowInfoText`, `ShowSkillCheckResult`, and `ApseModalDialog.OpenQuestionDialog`
  with real confirm/cancel callbacks. All **push-only**, which is the opposite
  direction from the closed native-state-read path, so none of this reopens it.
- **This also resolves a guess left open by session 1.**
  `WO-6-native-dice-findings.md` recorded `ShowDiceScore`'s 14 parameters from
  the RTTR dump as unnamed and explicitly flagged their meaning as "a **guess**".
  `HUD.xml` gives the real names.
- **`System` has no image/sprite primitive.** Clean negative, from the binary's
  own registration table and confirmed live. Every "draw a picture from Lua" idea
  dies there â€” which is exactly why the Flash route matters.
- **But `System.DrawText` takes a font name and RGB**, and the game ships
  `AlexanderQuill.ttf` registered as the CryFont `subtitles` (with a shadow
  pass). And **`Draw2DLine`** gives real screen-space vector geometry.
  Between them the "typographic floor" is actually a *vector* floor.
- **`DrawTriStrip` is documented by Warhorse but NOT registered in this build** â€”
  predicted from the DLL strings, then confirmed `nil` live. A useful reminder
  that the shipped docs describe a source tree, not this binary.

### Table identification (C1) â€” settled, with a real query

Not a heuristic and not a guess. `Scripts.pak` ships
`Entities/DiceInteractor.ent`, registering entity class **`DiceInteractor`**
against `Scripts/Entities/WH/Minigames/DiceInteractor.lua` â€” the script that puts
the `@ui_hud_play_dice` action on a `dice_board.cgf`. Run live:

```
System.GetEntitiesByClass("DiceInteractor")  ->  9 tables
  DiceInteractor1[Table/table_dice8_d4afcbd3-...]  d=1.2 m   <- player was standing at one
  DiceInteractor1[Table/table_dice4_14387850-...]  d=512.9 m
  ...seven more, 525 m - 1257 m
```

The distance spread is its own negative control â€” nearest 1.2 m, next 512.9 m â€”
so the 4 m gate cannot false-positive. Delivered as `KCD2MP_IsAtDiceTable(r)` /
`KCD2MP_NearestDiceTable(r)`, with `mp_dice_table` to re-verify after a patch.

### What was built

- **`docs/WO-6-visual-capability.md`** â€” five routes with evidence, effort and
  risk; the chosen tier; the probe results; licences checked. **No dependency
  adopted** (KCD2ModLoader is MIT and does have real ImGui drawing, but ImGui is
  the opposite of the brief's look and it is a second injected DLL â€” declined,
  with the reasoning recorded).
- **`docs/WO-6-overlay-design.md`** â€” palette, type, framing, the motion table
  (a moment per transition), state model, input feel.
- **The overlay itself**, in `kdcmp/Data/Scripts/Startup/kdcmp.lua`: an oak
  wager-board with a parchment score slip, vector dice with drawn pips,
  laid-paper ground, iron nailheads, leader dots, turn chevron, hold-to-confirm
  arc. Cast flicker with staggered settle, set-aside travel with gold flash,
  counting scores, sliding turn banner, bust shake + blood wash + "FARKLE", gold
  win flourish, open/close ramp. ~300 `Draw2DLine` calls per tick while open,
  zero when closed.
- **`tools/probe_visual.lua` + `tools/Probe-Visual.ps1`** â€” the A2 probe, in the
  proven `--@@BLOCK` harness. Read-only, self-cleaning, `-Cleanup` escape hatch.
- **Agent side**: `WireDiceFeedback` now pushes the full snapshot
  (`KCD2MP_DiceState`), rejections (`KCD2MP_DiceError`, with reasons in words)
  and the result (`KCD2MP_DiceEnd`); `OnGameEvent` handles `dice_intent` so the
  game is the input surface. **Engine and wire protocol untouched.**
- **`mp_dice_demo`** â€” drives the board through a full scripted match with
  fabricated snapshots. This exists because of the standing "one machine, no
  second human" constraint: it makes the visuals reviewable *today* instead of
  whenever a second PC appears. It sends no intents and cannot affect a session.

### Launcher window: retired, and the IPC decision

`DiceWindow.razor`, `DiceWindow.razor.css`, `Services/DiceIpcClient.cs` and
`Models/DiceModels.cs` are **deleted**, the `<DiceWindow />` mount and the DI
registration are gone. The launcher is a launcher.

The **agent-side** `DiceIpcServer`/`DiceIpcState` are **kept**, deliberately, and
that is documented at the top of `DiceIpcServer.cs`: it is the only way to
observe a real agent's dice state with no game running, and that is exactly how
WO-5 verified the agent-side dice code with two real `KcdMpClient` processes.
Deleting it would delete a proven headless test surface to save an idle loopback
listener. Not half-wired â€” deliberately unwired on the launcher side.

### Suites

All green, run this session: Farkle **59/59**, `Test-Dice` **10/10**,
`Test-Sessions` **22/22**, `Test-Combat` **14/14**, solution builds clean.
`Test-Pipe` needs the game plus the DLL and was not run â€” nothing native changed
this session.

### Traps hit

- **The console endpoint silently dropped a probe block** that was merely a bit
  long â€” no output, no error. Exactly what `probe_transport.lua`'s header warns
  about. Rewritten short, it worked first try. Keep blocks small.
- **`System.GetViewport()` returns a table**, not four values.
- **`powershell -File script.ps1 -Only a,b,c`** binds the whole comma list as ONE
  string, not an array. `Probe-Visual.ps1` now re-splits.
- **`HUD.xml` declares `<UIElement name="hud">` â€” lowercase.** The file is
  `HUD.xml`; the wrong case in `CallFunction` is a silent no-op.
- **Unicode die faces would be tofu.** AlexanderQuill has no U+2680..2685
  glyphs, so dice are vector-drawn, always. Recorded in the design doc before it
  could be made a second time.
- **A Blazor scoped `.css` outlives its component** and fails the build
  (`BLAZOR102`) â€” `DiceWindow.razor.css` had to go with `DiceWindow.razor`.

---

## NEEDS THE GAME â€” one sitting, in this order

Everything above was built without the game. These are the steps that need it,
batched. Steps 1-2 are prerequisites; 3-6 are independent after that.

**1. Install the new pak.** The game must be CLOSED for this.

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Build-And-Install-Mod.ps1
```

Then launch via the **KCD2 Modding Tools** Steam entry, load a save, and confirm
`[KCD2-MP] === MOD INIT ===` in `kcd.log`.

**2. Review the board â€” the big one.** Walk to any tavern dice table, then in the
console:

```
mp_dice_demo
```

That plays a ~30 s scripted match: open, cast, set aside, score tick, turn
hand-off, bust, opponent's turn, a rejected intent, and a win. **Describe what
you see** â€” this is the actual deliverable and the thing to screenshot. In
particular:

- Is the panel **on screen and correctly placed**? If it is tiny in the top-left
  corner, 2-D draws address a fixed virtual space rather than the back buffer â€”
  run `mp_dice_space 800 600` and `mp_dice_demo` again. That one command is the
  whole fix.
- Is the text in a **medieval hand and coloured**, or plain and white? White and
  plain means this build kept `DrawText`'s legacy 4-argument form; say so and
  `KCD2MP.dice.richText` gets set false (layout and dice are unaffected).
- Do the **rules and ground fade**, or is everything solid? That answers whether
  `Draw2DLine` honours alpha.
- Does the **motion read** â€” do dice flicker and settle, does the score count up,
  does the bust shake, does the win flourish?

**3. The visual probe**, for the native panels the board can layer on top:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Probe-Visual.ps1
```

It pauses on each visual block and prints what to look for. **Watch the game**
during the pauses. Remember: a Flash call logging `=true` only means it did not
throw â€” only what you saw counts. If something gets stuck on screen, re-run with
`-Cleanup`.

Each panel that genuinely renders flips one flag in `KCD2MP.dice.native`
(`modal`, `infotext`, `sting`, `score`) â€” all default **off**, so nothing ships
enabled on a guess.

**4. Confirm table gating.** At a table: `mp_dice_table` should report a distance
of a couple of metres. Walk well away and run it again: it should report none
within 25 m. Then `mp_dice` should refuse away from a table and attempt an invite
at one.

**5. Find the real keys.** Set `KCD2MP.logActions = true`, press the key you want
for each of cast / mark / bank / yield, and read the `ACT '<name>'` lines out of
`kcd.log`. Send those names back â€” the current
`DICE_CONFIRM_ACTIONS`/`DICE_BANK_ACTIONS`/`DICE_YIELD_ACTIONS`/
`DICE_MARK_PREFIXES` tables are **unverified guesses** and are all gated on the
board being open, so a wrong guess is a dead key, never an unwanted action. The
`mp_dice_*` console commands work regardless.

**6. NPC dice unaffected â€” confirm by playing one.** Sit down with any dice NPC
and play a normal game. Nothing of this mod should appear: the board only opens
from a `SessionStarted(Dice)` or a `DiceState`, neither of which a native game
produces.

### Still unverified after all that, and honestly so

- **A real two-player match at real latency.** One machine, one copy of the game,
  no second human. The whole PvP path is designed and headlessly proven but the
  two-humans-at-one-table behaviour stays **unverified until a second machine
  exists**.
- **The frame cost of ~300 `Draw2DLine` calls per tick.** Reasoned, not measured.
  `KCD2MP.dice.groundStep` is the knob if it ever shows up.


---

## Session 2, part 2 â€” the vector renderer failed; the game's own panel shipped

Appended after the first live review. The runbook above is superseded in one
respect: `mp_dice_demo` is still the right entry point, but the board is no
longer drawn by us.

### What the human saw, and what it proved

First live run: **nothing rendered at all.** Diagnosed from the log rather than
guessed â€” `labelRunning=false` while `diceOpen=true`. The board's draw loop was
hung off `KCD2MP_LabelTick`, which only starts when the agent calls
`KCD2MP_StartInterp`; with no agent running, the state machine ran perfectly and
painted nothing. My bug. `KCD2MP_DiceClose` had the same dependency, so the board
also could not close. Both fixed: the board owns its own lifecycle.

Second live run, with a render loop forced on: **only text appeared.** That
turned out not to be a bug at all â€”

**`System.Draw2DLine` renders nothing from Lua in this build.** Registered,
callable, silent; `r_enableAuxGeom` and `r_AuxGeom` both already `1`; a red
pixel-space box and a green 0..1-space box drawn together in a live 28 fps loop
produced neither, while `DrawText` in the same frames rendered fine. The entire
vector design â€” frame, dice, pips, rules, and most of the motion table in
`WO-6-overlay-design.md` â€” was built on a primitive that does not work.

Third instance of "registered but inert" in this project, after `DrawTriStrip`
and Lua writes. **A scriptbind entry proves nothing; only observed effect does.**

### What replaced it, and why it is better

The board is now HTML pushed into the game's own tutorial panel:
`UIAction.CallFunction("hud", -1, "ShowTutorial", id, html, ...)`. A gilded
gothic frame around illuminated parchment, rendered by the game, with full
control of colour, weight, size and typeface â€” including `Manuscript`, a real
blackletter hand. We supply markup; Warhorse supplies the art. This is a better
outcome than the panel I designed, and it cost less.

Full capability table, verified negatives, the 774-codepoint glyph inventory
extracted from `gfxfontlib_glyphs.gfx`, and every trap are in the CORRECTION
section of `docs/WO-6-visual-capability.md`. The headline traps:

- `ShowTutorial` **queues, it does not replace** â€” always `HideTutorial(id)` first.
- `hud.ShowDiceScore` is **inert** outside the native minigame.
- `<img src='img://...'>` parses but **never resolves** in this field, including a
  path copied verbatim out of `hud.gfx` â€” the text field has no image loader.
- ASCII `|` is in the font's CodeTable and renders as **nothing**.
- Roman numerals, `â– `, and the private-use glyphs are in the CodeTable and are
  **tofu**. In the table does not mean it has a glyph.
- Unicode die faces, box-drawing, block elements and `â—` are all absent, which is
  why dice are pip grids of `â€¢` and non-breaking space (self-aligning by
  construction in a proportional font).

### Iteration from the human's review

Three rounds of live screenshots produced concrete fixes, all in the source:

- Rules shortened from 13 em dashes to 9 â€” at 13 they wrapped and left a row of
  orphaned dashes after every divider.
- Dice gap widened to three spaces â€” at one the dice ran together into an
  undifferentiated field of dots.
- A numbered row added under the board dice, so `mp_dice_mark 3` is unambiguous
  instead of requiring the player to count pip clusters. This was most of what
  made the controls feel confusing.
- The action strip now lists **only the console commands that actually work**. It
  previously advertised `[E]`/`[1-6]`/`[B]`/`[X]` keybinds that are unverified
  guesses and probably dead, which read as broken rather than as a hint.
- `tallyRow` sized its leader dots with `#score`, but the score is groschen-
  formatted markup containing `&nbsp;` entities, so a 4-digit score counted as
  10+ characters and the leaders collapsed on every row. Now sized from the digit
  count.

### Two mistakes of mine worth recording

- **Lua 5.1 has no `\u` escape.** I used `'` for quotes inside Lua strings
  twice; it produces the literal text `u0027`, which invalidated every HTML
  attribute and rendered an empty panel. Only affected live-preview scaffolding,
  never the source file, but it cost two review cycles.
- **The console silently drops oversized chunks.** A ~1.6 KB string assignment
  vanished with no output and no error â€” the exact trap `probe_transport.lua`'s
  own header documents. Build long strings by appending ~150-character pieces.

### Images: closed, with the art sitting right there

The game ships exactly the right assets â€” `Libs/UI/Textures/Dynamic/dice_0.dds`
through `dice_5.dds`, `dice_dot.dds`, `dice_frame.dds`, `dice_frame_yellow.dds`,
plus `dice_sides.dds` (almost certainly the outlined dice on the in-game rules
screen) â€” and `hud.gfx` itself references images as `img://Libs/UI/Textures/...`,
so the protocol is the game's own. It still cannot be used: the tutorial panel's
text field has no image loader, proven with a path lifted verbatim from
`hud.gfx`. **This is a display-surface problem, not an asset problem** â€” art from
Nexus, or art drawn by hand, hits the identical wall.

Searched Nexus and GitHub for prior art: every KCD2 dice mod is either an XML
balance tweak ([Farkle Improved - PTF](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2830),
[Better Dice Players](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/2724),
[Easy Dice AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/244)) or an
external web tool ([Dice Optimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/588)).
**No mod ships in-game dice UI art.** KCD2 UI modding is universally *replacing*
`hud.gfx` and its textures, and such mods are mutually incompatible by
construction. Routes 1 and 2 here touch neither, so this overlay is compatible
with every HUD mod on Nexus â€” a real, non-obvious argument for the approach.

---

## NEXT WO â€” a real custom overlay

The human's closing idea, and it is the right next question: rather than living
inside the tutorial panel, give both players a **large custom overlay with custom
art** once a match starts. Recorded here as the recommended next work order,
with honest costs, because it is exactly what the "every bell and whistle" brief
wanted and the tutorial panel is a ceiling on it.

Three routes, in increasing order of both cost and payoff:

1. **Reuse a bigger existing UIElement.** 28 exist; only `hud` and one
   `ApseModalDialog` call were ever tested. `GeneralBook` is the standout
   candidate: a 1024x1024 element that declares **both** a `Texts` and an
   `Images` array (`g_TextsA` / `g_ImagesA`), i.e. a declared image channel the
   tutorial panel lacks. `ItemSelection` and `ApseModalDialog.OpenRandomEventDialog`
   (which takes an `IconId`) are also untested. **Status: probe started and
   inconclusive** â€” the game entered a level load mid-probe. Cheap to retry and
   should be the first thing tried.
   Caveat: `GeneralBook`'s constraint is `mode="fixdyntexsize"`, so it may render
   into a dynamic texture consumed by a book mesh rather than straight to screen.
   Unverified either way.
2. **Ship our own `.gfx` UIElement.** Full control: any size, any art, our own
   image loader. This is Route 3 from the capability doc, deferred at session
   start for reasons that still hold: `.gfx` is compiled Scaleform, authoring
   needs tooling we do not have (JPEXS can read and edit but round-tripping a
   newly authored file with working ActionScript is unreliable), and it is
   **unverified whether a mod pak registers a new `Libs/UI/UIElements/*.xml` at
   all**. Two independent unknowns; a session that can end with nothing.
3. **Draw from the native plugin.** `KCDMP.dll` is already injected with proven
   main-thread marshalling. Hooking the D3D12 present chain and rendering our own
   overlay gives unlimited size, custom textures and full art direction, and
   touches **no** game asset, so it conflicts with nothing.
   [`xiaoxiao921/KCD2ModLoader`](https://github.com/xiaoxiao921/KCD2ModLoader)
   is an off-the-shelf MIT-licensed implementation of exactly this, with Dear
   ImGui bound into Lua. It was declined in session 2 on the grounds that ImGui
   looks like a debug tool â€” but that objection is weaker than it appeared:
   ImGui's draw list renders arbitrary textured quads (`AddImage`), so the dice
   art could be our own `.dds` files with no ImGui chrome visible at all.
   Cost: real native work, plus either a dependency or our own swapchain hook.
   MIT is GPLv3-compatible.

**Recommendation:** try route 1 first (an afternoon, might just work), and if it
does not, treat route 3 as the real answer â€” it is the only one with no ceiling,
and this project has already demonstrated the native capability it needs. Route 2
is the worst of the three: as much work as 3 with a harder toolchain and a
conflict surface.

Do not start any of this before the runbook above has been run against the
shipped pak â€” the text board is what exists, and it should be verified working
before it is replaced.


### Trap: a UTF-8 BOM silently kills the entire mod script

Found on the first real play test of the shipped pak. Every `mp_*` console
command reported "unknown command". The only evidence anywhere:

```
Loading and executing script file 'Scripts/Startup/kdcmp.lua'...
[Warning] Validator: [Lua Error] Failed to execute file @scripts/startup/kdcmp.lua:
  scripts/startup/kdcmp.lua:1: unexpected symbol near '<?>'
[Error] Load of startup script file 'Scripts\Startup\kdcmp.lua' has failed
```

**Lua 5.1 cannot parse a UTF-8 byte order mark.** One BOM on line 1 means the
whole file fails to compile: no mod init, no commands, no `[KCD2-MP]` lines at
all. Nothing crashes and nothing else is logged, so from in-game it looks
exactly like "the mod isn't installed".

**How it got there:** PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content`/`Out-File -Encoding utf8`
writes a BOM. Any tool-assisted rewrite of `kdcmp.lua` can add one. The same
operation also mojibaked existing comments, because `Get-Content` read the UTF-8
source as ANSI before re-encoding it — arrows and em-dashes became `â†’` style
sequences. Harmless to Lua (comments only) but it is real corruption, reversed
with a cp1252 → UTF-8 round trip.

**Guarded now:** `tools\Build-And-Install-Mod.ps1` refuses to pack a `.lua` that
starts with a BOM and prints the fix. Always write Lua with
`New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding($false)`, never `Set-Content -Encoding utf8`.

**Diagnostic habit this reinforces:** when the mod appears absent in game, grep
`kcd.log` for `Startup/kdcmp` *before* anything else. The load line and its error
are always there, and they are decisive. The generic "no `[KCD2-MP]` lines" check
is what surfaced it here.

### Keybinds: discovered, not guessed (2026-07-29)

Captured with `KCD2MP.logActions = true` against a live game, pressing each
candidate and reading the `ACT` lines out of `kcd.log`. What the keys emit:

| Key | Actions |
|---|---|
| E | `use`, `talk`, `pickpocketing`, `trigger_use`, `mount_horse`, `use_bed_*`, `attack_abort` |
| R | `toggle_torch` |
| F | `knock_out`, `stealth_kill`, `mercy_kill`, `butcher`, `grab_body`, `horse_pulldown` |
| X | `call`, `use_horse` |
| 1-6 | `action_qam_1` .. `action_qam_6` (plus `_hold` variants on 5 and 6) |

**The constraint that decided the mapping:** our `OnAction` hook runs IN
ADDITION to the game's and cannot consume the input, so any bound key still does
its normal job too. That rules out **E** -- the obvious pick for "cast" -- because
`use` at a dice table fires the table's own "Play dice" interaction and would
start the NPC minigame underneath our board.

Chosen for having harmless defaults while seated at a board:

| Action | Key | Normal side effect |
|---|---|---|
| cast / set aside | **R** `toggle_torch` | toggles the torch |
| mark die 1-6 | **1-6** `action_qam_1..6` | QAM slot use |
| bank (hold) | **F** `knock_out` | nothing without a valid target |
| yield (hold) | **X** `call` | whistles for the horse |

Bindings are gated on `KCD2MP.dice.open`, so none fire outside a match, and
every `mp_dice_*` console command still works as the fallback.

**Do not bind to `open_menu`** -- it appeared repeatedly during capture and
would open the game menu on every press.

## Session 3 -- 2026-07-30 -- real keybinds, the panel rework, bust visibility

Started from the handoff at the end of Session 2. All three "verify first"
items got done, but not cleanly -- each one uncovered something the previous
session's design had wrong, and this session is mostly the trail of fixing
those, in order.

### Seat gate and steadiness: confirmed, no surprises

The three seat-gate checks (far from a bench, near but not seated, actually
seated) all matched expectations, and `mp_dice_demo` was confirmed steady
after last session's flicker fix -- the remaining "flicker" the human first
reported turned out to be the demo itself, which fires ~10 fabricated
snapshots in 30 s on purpose, faster than any real turn ever would. Not a bug.

### The keybinds: R/F/X/1-6 failed in real play, worse than expected

Playing a real match surfaced two problems Session 2's design didn't catch:

1. **1-6 drew a sword mid-match.** The mod's `OnAction` hook cannot consume
   input, so `action_qam_N` firing was never going to be silent -- but nobody
   had actually watched what physically happens when you press a QAM-bound
   key outside the QAM wheel. It equips the weapon/food slot immediately,
   full stop, whether or not the wheel is open. Disabled behind
   `enableMarkKeys = false` immediately; console `mp_dice_mark N` carried the
   feature until this was replaced properly.
2. **R (`toggle_torch`) was flaky while seated.** First diagnosed (wrongly)
   as R being remapped to `sitting_exit_up` while seated -- the ACT capture
   showed `sitting_exit_up` right before a batch of `toggle_torch` presses,
   read as causation. `Libs/Config/keybindSuperactions.xml` (see below) later
   showed R is bound to exactly `toggle_torch` + `reset_tutorials_action`,
   nothing sitting-related at all -- `sitting_exit_up` is on W/Up, and the
   capture almost certainly caught the sit-down transition itself, not the R
   press. Recorded here so a future reader does not re-trust the earlier
   claim; the true cause of R's unreliability while seated is still not
   confirmed, and no longer matters since R is retired.

### First attempted fix: a native keyboard hook -- built, then removed

Reasoned that since the game's action-map is what limits Lua's `OnAction`
(only fires for a key the map already resolves to *something*), a
lower-level Windows hook could see physical keys the game had no opinion on
at all. Built `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` into `KCDMP.dll` (`dice_input_hook.cpp/h`,
new `pipe::kDiceKey` (0x91) frame, `CombatPipe.OnDiceKey`,
`GameBridge.HandleDiceKey`), scan-code matched (not vkCode, which is
NumLock-dependent) against Numpad 0/1-6/+/-.

**It does not work, for a reason specific to this game.** Exhaustive testing
(four rebuild-reinject cycles) found the hook never sees ANY key -- not just
Numpad, literally anything -- while KCD2 has focus. It only ever caught the
human's own typed chat replies from *other* windows, proving the hook
mechanism itself was fine. Conclusion: KCD2 reads keyboard input through
DirectInput in exclusive-acquisition mode while focused, which never
generates the Win32 message-level events `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` taps into. A
correct fix would mean hooking DirectInput's device-state calls directly --
a materially bigger, riskier native undertaking than this WO scoped, and not
attempted.

**A real trust incident happened along the way and is worth recording
honestly.** An early diagnostic build of the hook logged *every* keystroke
system-wide (to debug why Numpad wasn't registering) before a
foreground-window check was added -- it captured the human typing chat
replies to the assistant in another window. The human, reasonably, asked
directly whether a keylogger had been built or would be committed. Answer
given at the time and still true: no, the shipped code (once fixed) only
ever acted on 9 specific scan codes while the game had focus, and nothing
resembling broad key logging was ever committed -- but the diagnostic
*build*, while it existed, genuinely did do that, and the stray captured
text (two lines: "Done" and "pressed num -16") was deleted from the local
log file on request. The hook and all its wiring were fully reverted
(`git checkout` on every touched native/agent file) once proven not to work,
specifically so nothing like it would sit in the tree unused. `git status`
and a repo-wide grep for `WH_KEYBOARD_LL`/`SetWindowsHookEx` confirm none of
it is in the commit that shipped.

### The real fix: `keybindSuperactions.xml` is moddable, and so is `defaultProfile.xml`

The human found a Nexus mod ("Hotkeys Unlocked") that edits
`Libs/Config/keybindSuperactions.xml` to unlock QAM/consumable rebinding.
Inspecting its pak (just that one XML file) showed the real mechanism: one
physical key (a "superaction") can carry MULTIPLE named actions across
different `map=` contexts simultaneously, and the game's own action-map
system decides which one is live based on player state. This is exactly
`sitting_exit_up` vs `toggle_torch` on different keys, in the open --
Warhorse ships this as plain data, not compiled logic.

Shipped our own addition to this file (not depending on the third-party
mod) defining new action names (`kcd2mp_dice_mark_1..6`,
`kcd2mp_dice_cast`, `kcd2mp_dice_bank`, `kcd2mp_dice_yield`,
`kcd2mp_dice_cancel`) on physical keys, under `map="interaction"` -- chosen
because `use`/`talk`/`trigger_use` (also under `interaction`) were directly
observed firing immediately after sitting down, unlike `sitting`-shadowed
actions.

**First attempt still did nothing -- a second file was needed.**
`keybindSuperactions.xml` alone declares which key names *could* map to
which actions; it is not what registers an action with the live action-map
system at all. `Libs/Config/defaultProfile.xml` is the other half -- it
declares `<actionmap>` blocks with `<action name="..." keyboard="_keybinds_ref_">`
entries, and an action absent from this file's actionmaps never fires via
`OnAction`, no matter what `keybindSuperactions.xml` says. Confirmed via the
`[DIAG]` a=press` capture: zero `ACT` lines for `kcd2mp_dice_cast` until the
matching entry was added to `defaultProfile.xml`'s `interaction` actionmap,
then it fired first press. Both files are now shipped in this mod's own
pak; per the Nexus mod's own compatibility note, this makes the mod
incompatible with any other mod that also edits either file -- an accepted,
disclosed tradeoff of using this mechanism at all.

**Picking the actual keys cost several more live-tested traps, none visible
from the XML's own contents:**

- Numpad 1-6 checked clean (nothing else in the file claims them) but
  wasn't -- `weapon_slot_N` under `apse_qam_slots` turned out to stay active
  during ordinary play, not gated behind the QAM wheel being open. Adding an
  action to a key never suppresses whatever else is already bound there.
- The Numpad operator keys and F1/F3/F10 are bound to engine-level debug
  toggles (photo mode, flight mode, AI/animation debug draw) entirely
  outside this XML. **Numpad `/` crashed the game outright** when tested live.
- **H** is also "clean" by the XML's contents and is not safe either -- it
  opens a Modding Tools debug menu.
- `np_decimal` is a different failure shape: not dangerous, just not a
  control name this engine's action-map recognises at all, so the entry
  silently never registers -- indistinguishable at a glance from a working
  key with nothing to do yet.

**Final layout**, every key pressed live and watched before being trusted:
F2/F4/F5/F6/F7/F8 mark dice 1-6, F9 casts/sets aside, hold F11 banks, hold
F12 yields, U clears every pending mark without rerolling
(`KCD2MP_DiceUnmarkAll`, added on request so a bad partial selection does
not have to be committed to start over). Bank/yield briefly lived on U/Y
instead, to leave F11/F12 free for a future invite-accept bind -- reverted
back to F11/F12 when U/np_decimal turned out mixed (U worked, np_decimal
didn't), on the human's own call to keep only keys already proven
end-to-end rather than add a fifth key family.

### The live board: panel is primary again, but debounced this time

The human, having seen the panel's start/end card, asked directly for it to
be the whole live board again -- explicitly aware this was the design that
flickered before. The fix was not "never push the panel", it was "don't
push once per keystroke": `KCD2MP_DiceRender()` still pushes immediately on
relay-driven state (a new roll, an error, match end), which is naturally
paced by however long a turn takes; a new `scheduleRender()` debounces the
one thing that actually flickered -- local rapid-fire marking -- coalescing
a burst of presses into one push instead of one each.

Two more rounds of live feedback, both real bugs:

- **Alignment drift, again, different cause.** Fixed the DrawText-era
  padding bug last session; this session's panel version drifted for a
  different reason -- an "unlit" pip rendered as blank space (`&nbsp;`),
  which is not the same width as a lit bullet in this proportional font, so
  a die's total rendered width depended on its face (a 1 much narrower than
  a 6). Fixed by rendering every cell as an actual bullet, colour-only
  toggling between the die's colour and a new `COL.faint` (close to the
  parchment) for "unlit" -- every die is now the same width regardless of
  face, structurally, not by tuning a gap.
- **The gap itself then had to shrink.** Widening it earlier (single-digit
  die indices) broke once index labels became 2-character F-key names
  (`F2`..`F8`) -- six of them plus a wide gap no longer fit one line and
  wrapped. Replaced the wide all-NBSP gap with a single broken-bar divider
  (`¦`, already proven renderable) between dice: narrower, and reads as an
  actual boundary between dice rather than empty space -- explicitly asked
  for ("married... not confusing").
- Gold (`COL.bright`, `#e8c25c`) was too close to the parchment's own
  lightness to read at a glance; darkened to `#96691a`.
- `panelMs` (the safety-expiry) was raised from 2 minutes to 30 -- it
  visibly expired mid-match during the seated-R debugging, when no new roll
  was going through for several minutes and nothing else was re-pushing it.

### Bust visibility: a real engine + wire-protocol change, stated up front

Asked for by the human: on a bust, show what was actually rolled, and say
"Bust!" rather than just "nothing scored". Checked first, rather than
guessed: `FarkleGame.Roll()` clears `_freeDice` (`ResetTurnState()`) in the
same call that busts it, before `SendDiceState` ever runs -- the busted
roll was never on the wire at all, for either client, so this could not be
a presentation-only fix. Confirmed as in-scope with the human before
touching the engine, per this WO's own "presentation and input only, state
a reason" rule.

Minimal version: `FarkleGame.LastBustedDice` captures the roll before
`ResetTurnState()` clears it; `DiceState` (0x17) grows one trailing
`[bustedDiceCount][bustedDiceFaces]` field, empty except on the one
snapshot immediately after a bust. Wire-compatible with old parsers
(`Test-Dice.ps1`, `Bot-DiceOpponent.ps1`) since the framing is
length-prefixed and they simply never read past `keptFaces`. The board's
bust/bank distinction now reads this directly (`#bustedFaces > 0`) instead
of the old heuristic (score unchanged across a turn hand-off), which
retired `D.seenState` (dead once the heuristic was gone) as a side effect.
All four suites (Farkle 59/59, Test-Dice 10/10, Test-Sessions 22/22,
Test-Combat 14/14) stayed green.

### New tool: `tools/Bot-DiceOpponent.ps1`

A raw-TCP scripted opponent (same wire-protocol technique as
`Test-Dice.ps1`, but long-running and interactive rather than a fixed
test), built because verifying real keybinds needs an actual open session,
and there is still no second human or machine. Plays its own turns with the
same greedy keep policy `Test-Dice.ps1` uses; the human's side is entirely
real keyboard input. This is how every keybind in this session was actually
verified against a live match rather than just `mp_dice_demo`.

### Shipped: commit `9cf7b9d`

Everything in this session -- the two new XML files, the kdcmp.lua rework,
the wire/engine change for bust faces, the new bot tool -- is pushed. The
abandoned native hook is not: confirmed via `git status` and a repo-wide
grep for `WH_KEYBOARD_LL`/`SetWindowsHookEx`/`dice_input_hook` before
staging, specifically because the human had just, reasonably, asked
whether anything resembling a keylogger was about to ship.

### Handoff -- requested for next session, not started

1. **On a Farkle loss, transfer the wager to the winner.** Currently a pure
   score abstraction; this needs real currency to move, which per
   `[[lua-writes-are-inert]]` means a native (RTTR) write, not a Lua one --
   scope it against `docs/NATIVE-PLUGIN-findings.md` before starting.
2. **A native invite-send control, no console command.** `DICE_INVITE_ACTIONS`
   (`dialog_answer3/4`) is still an unverified guess from WO-5; the
   `keybindSuperactions.xml`/`defaultProfile.xml` technique proven this
   session is the likely correct fix, the same way cast/mark/bank/yield
   were solved.
3. **A native invite-accept/decline control, no console command.** Same
   technique, same caveat -- `ACCEPT_ACTIONS`/`DECLINE_ACTIONS` are guesses
   too. F11/F12 were deliberately left unbound this session specifically to
   leave room for these two.
4. **Improve `KCDMP_launcher` to fetch its own dependencies**, rather than
   requiring `dotnet run` against the relay and agent by hand. Build on the
   existing launcher; do not start over.
