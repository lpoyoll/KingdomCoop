# Project state — supersedes the original engineering brief

Current as of 2026-07-28, branch `main`, pushed to
`DeepFriedDepp/kcd2-multiplayer_Reworked`.

**Read this before the original brief.** The brief remains the best statement of
*intent*, but several of its factual sections are now wrong — it predates the
native plugin, and a fresh session that trusts §3/§4/§5.2 will design around
limits that no longer exist, or re-derive dead ends at length.

---

## 1. Work order ledger

The brief numbered six work orders. Actual state:

| Brief WO | Scope | State | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| WO-0 | Merge four branches onto `main`, version byte | **done** | `WO-0-merge-notes.md` |
| WO-1 | Transport replacement | **done** | `WO-1-transport.md` |
| WO-2 | Interaction framework (opt-in paired sessions) | **done**, 23/23 tests | protocol `0x0A`–`0x11` |
| WO-3 | Dice (Farkle) | **done** — committed as `WO-5:` (see the naming collision note below) | `WO-5-dice.md`, protocol `0x16`–`0x19` |
| WO-4 | Emotes | **not started** | — |
| WO-5 | Duelling | **not started** | — |

**Plus two unplanned work orders, not in the brief:**

| — | **Shared combat** — damage and death replicate between clients | **done** | `HANDOFF-WO4-combat.md` |
| — | **Appearance sync** — ghosts mirror the real player's equipped items, not one hardcoded outfit | **done** | `WO-9-appearance-sync.md`, protocol `0x1A`-`0x1B` |

### Naming collision — fix this

Shared combat was labelled "WO-4" throughout its commits and documents. The
brief's WO-4 is **Emotes**. They are unrelated. Suggested renumbering:

- shared combat → **WO-6** (or "WO-C"), retroactively
- Dice, Emotes, Duelling keep their brief numbers

Whatever is chosen, say it explicitly in the next session's prompt, because
`git log` is full of "WO-4:" prefixes that mean shared combat.

The same collision now applies to dice: the brief calls it WO-3, but the
session prompt that commissioned it (superseding all earlier dice planning
docs) renumbered it **WO-5**, and every commit that built it says `WO-5:`.
"WO-5" in `git log` means dice, not duelling — the brief's WO-5.

---

## 2. Corrections to the brief

### §3 "Verified negative results" — still true, but Lua-only

Every item in that list holds **for the Lua sandbox**. None of it constrains
native code. The brief's framing invites the wrong conclusion, so state it
plainly: *Lua writes are inert; the engine is not.*

### §4 "The product design" — materially changed

The brief says: *"NOT a shared-world co-op mod… NPCs never know a second player
exists… no combat participation… a ghost is a prop… no server-side world state."*

That is no longer the design. Per `ARCHITECTURE-shared-world.md` and the native
work, the boundary now falls between **generic and unique NPCs**, not between
world and progression:

- **Shared:** damage and death on hand-placed generic NPCs.
- **Private:** quests, dialogue, journal, reputation, progression — unchanged.
- **Relay is still stateless.** Authority is per-hit, held by the client whose
  player landed the blow. That part of the brief survives intact.

Quest-state sync, save merging and entity streaming remain out of scope and
remain the right call.

### §5.2 "Duelling" — its central premise is now false

The brief says ghosts *"cannot deal or receive damage"* and that a real synced
fight *"is not achievable on the current transport."*

- **Damage is achievable.** Replicated damage lands on real NPCs, verified both
  directions end to end.
- **The transport objection is weaker** — the DLL pipe is a real push channel,
  not a polled one.
- **But the duel bubble is still the right design**, for a different reason:
  directional combat state, perfect blocks and clinches are per-frame and would
  need a per-frame sync the pipe can carry but the *relay* round trip cannot at
  fighting latency. Keep the bubble; drop the "cannot deal damage" rationale.

### §2.2 "Highest-priority engineering problem" — solved

The no-push-channel problem is solved twice: log-tail out (WO-1) and the DLL
named pipe (shared combat). Any new feature should assume a push channel exists.

### §5.1 "Dice" presentation options — REVERSED in WO-6

Recommendation (b), the launcher window, is what WO-5 built (`WO-5-dice.md`).
**WO-6 retired it.** `DiceWindow.razor` and the launcher's IPC client are
deleted; the dice UI is now an in-game overlay drawn by `kdcmp.lua`, and the
launcher is only a launcher. The agent-side `DiceIpcServer` survives as a
documented headless-test surface, not as a UI channel.

This document previously said the native plugin "does not make Scaleform (c)
any more tractable — the GUI module's reflected surface was never examined."
**That statement was about reflection, and it conflated two different
questions.** Corrected:

- *Reading* the native dice minigame's live state is closed, with strong
  evidence (`WO-6-native-dice-findings.md`). Unchanged.
- *Pushing* our own values into the game's UI is **wide open, and cheaper than
  anything this project guessed.** CryEngine's Flash UI system is intact and
  reachable from our Lua sandbox: `UIAction.CallFunction`, `SetVariable`,
  `SetArray`, `SetPos`/`Scale`/`Alpha`/`Visible`, `GotoAndPlay` and
  `RegisterElementListener` are all live (verified in game, 2026-07-29). The
  game's own `hud` element already exposes `ShowDiceScore`, `AddDiceSelector`,
  `ShowTutorial` (HTML), `ShowInfoText` and `ShowSkillCheckResult`, and
  `ApseModalDialog` exposes a real yes/no modal with callbacks.

Full evidence and the effort/risk of each route: `WO-6-visual-capability.md`.

**But narrow that down further, because WO-6 also found the limits.** What works
is *pushing text* into an existing element: `hud.ShowTutorial` (HTML, and it is
the gilded parchment panel the dice board now uses) and `hud.ShowInfoText`. What
does **not** work: `hud.ShowDiceScore` is inert outside the native minigame, and
`<img src='img://...'>` never resolves in a tutorial text field even with a path
copied verbatim out of `hud.gfx`. **No images, and no `System.Draw2DLine` at
all** — that call is registered, callable, silent, and not CVar-gated, which
makes it the third "registered but inert" surface in this project after
`DrawTriStrip` and Lua writes. `System.DrawText` is the only screen-space draw
primitive that works from Lua.

**The single most useful thing found in WO-6, for any future work:** the
Modding Tools ship **Warhorse's own Lua scriptbind reference** at
`Tools/modding/docs/script_bind/script_bind.zip` (dated 2025-01-14, 5,014
pages). It is authoritative for every `System.*`, `UIAction.*`, `Script.*` and
entity binding, and this project had never opened it. Look there **first**
before probing or guessing an API — but still confirm against the DLL's own
scriptbind registration strings, because the docs describe a source tree and
list at least one method (`System.DrawTriStrip`) this build does not register.

---

## 3. What now exists that the brief does not describe

### The native plugin (`native/`)

- **`KCDMP.dll`** — injected into the game. `KCDMP_LauncherInjector.exe` —
  `--pid <pid> --dll <path>`, the exact contract `KCDMP_launcher` already
  expected. Both build via `native\Build-Native.ps1` (MSVC, installed, not on
  PATH).
- **RTTR reflection ABI** — `CrySystem.dll` exports the whole rttr runtime, so
  the game's object model is drivable **by name**: no offsets, no signature
  scans. Hand-modelled ABI in `rttr_abi.h`, every layout claim carrying the
  disassembly evidence that produced it.
- **Main-thread marshalling** — IAT hook on `C_ModulesManager::Update` in
  `WHGame.dll`. Chosen over an inline detour: one aligned pointer store, no
  instruction relocation, reverses cleanly. Runs at 26–79 Hz.
- **Object walk** — `C_GameInterface::GetWritableInstance()` (exported from
  `Shared.dll`) → `RPGModule` → `SoulList` → `Soul` → `CombatSoul`.
- **Soul lookup by `SharedSoulGuid`**, the cross-client key.
- **Outbound detection by sampling**, not hooking — see §5.

### The agent↔DLL pipe

`\\.\pipe\kcdmp`, DLL hosts, agent connects. Framing matches the relay protocol.
`0x01 ApplyDamage`, `0x02 ApplyDeath`, `0x03 Ping` down; `0x81 Result`,
`0x83 Pong`, `0x90 LocalHit` up. **Overlapped I/O on both handles is mandatory**
— see §5.

### Wire protocol v5

Added `0x12`–`0x15` (Damage/Death, both directions) in v3, `0x16`–`0x19`
(DiceIntent/DiceState/DiceError/DiceEnd) in v4, and `0x1A`–`0x1B`
(AppearanceUp/AppearanceDown) in v5. `Protocol.cs` is **no longer
duplicated** — it moved to a shared `KcdMp.Protocol` project (net8.0 classlib,
namespace `KcdMp.Wire` to avoid a name collision with the `Protocol` class
itself) that both `KcdMp.Client` and `KcdMp.Server` reference. One copy, kept
in sync with itself by construction.

Since then: `0x1C`–`0x1D` (PauseUp/PauseDown, WO-11), `0x1E` (ReleaseVersion,
WO-19), `0x1F`–`0x25` (shared player combat, WO-28), `0x26`–`0x27`
(NPC sync, WO-32 — real hand-placed NPCs streamed from the world authority,
behind `mp_npc_sync`, off by default; see `docs/WO-32-findings.md`),
`0x28`–`0x29` (time-skip sync, WO-38), `0x2A`–`0x2B` (horse identity, WO-38),
`0x2C`–`0x2D` (combat visibility, WO-39), `0x2E`–`0x2F` (weather, WO-40),
`0x30`–`0x31` (name-addressed NPC damage, WO-40), and `0x32`–`0x35`
(dropped-item sync, WO-48 — transactional drop/claim, relay echo is the race
arbiter; see `docs/WO-48-findings.md`).

**Next free type byte: `0x36`.** *(This line has been stale twice now.
`Protocol.cs`'s own "free type bytes" comment is the authority — check it
there, not here.)*

**WO-28 — shared player combat, `0x1F`–`0x25`** (`docs/WO-28-findings.md`).
Replicates a *player's own* health, hits taken from NPCs, and death. Addressed
by `ghostId`, never by soul GUID: every player's real Henry carries the same
`SharedSoulGuid` (`4c2dcffb-…` = `player_henry`), so a soul GUID cannot
distinguish one player from another even in principle.

- `0x1F`/`0x20` PlayerState — the owner's authoritative health/stamina,
  broadcast. Rendered by receivers, never computed by them.
- `0x21`/`0x22` PlayerHit — **routed to one recipient, not broadcast**, and
  carries *loss amounts*, not absolute values.
- `0x23`/`0x24` PlayerDeath — sent by the dying client only, never inferred
  from health reaching zero.
- `0x25` CombatRole — which client holds NPC→player damage authority. The
  relay designates the lowest-id ready client; without exactly one holder, N
  peers generate N damage streams for one fight and damage multiplies by N.

`Protocol.Version` stays at **6**: the layer is additive and an older client
ignores it, so a mixed session degrades rather than being hard-refused at
Handshake.

**The emit line is now `v2`** — `… <flags> <health> <stamina>`, flags gaining
bit 2 (dead) and bit 3 (unconscious). `LogTailGameTransport` parses `v1` and
`v2` both, because the pak and the agent install separately; a `v1` line means
"health unknown", which is never rendered as a zero.

### Test scripts (`tools\`)

| Script | Proves | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `Test-Combat.ps1` | relay forwarding, 14/14 | relay only |
| `Test-Pipe.ps1` | pipe → DLL → NPC | game + DLL |
| `Test-AppearanceE2E.ps1` | appearance sync end-to-end, synthetic peer → relay → agent → ghost | relay + agent + game (no DLL) |
| `Test-PlayerCombat.ps1` | WO-28 player health/hit/death routing and the damage-authority gate, 21/21 | relay only (starts its own) |
| `Test-PlayerVitalsE2E.ps1` | WO-28 end-to-end: ghost health renders, death tags, `v1` compat, all three Flow B guards + a positive control, 17/17 | relay + agent + game (no DLL) |
| `Test-ReloadBehaviour.ps1` | what a mid-session save reload does to the connection, the mod's timer chains and ghost entities | relay + agent + game + a human to reload |
| `Test-CombatE2E.ps1` | inbound, full chain | everything |
| `Test-CombatOutbound.ps1` | outbound, full chain | everything |
| `Test-Sessions.ps1` | WO-2 sessions, 23/23 | relay only |
| `Test-Dice.ps1` | WO-5 dice, 10/10 | relay only |
| `Probe-Reflection.ps1` | capability re-check after a game patch | game |
| `KcdApi.ps1` | bounded REST client — dot-source it | game |

`dotnet\KcdMp.Farkle.Tests` (xUnit, 59/59) covers the dice scoring/turn state
machine itself, headless, no relay needed — see `WO-5-dice.md`.

## 4. Closed as not achievable — do not re-derive

- **Aggro / stimulus injection via reflection/native surfaces.** No reachable
  surface. `xgen` reflected = two read-only properties; `XBehaviorModule` =
  empty; XGenAIModule's 1,784 exports are behaviour-tree enum glue;
  `SkirmishManager::DebugTriggerEvent` does nothing observable outside a
  running skirmish. **The shipped path remains WO-15/16/17's native faction
  `SetParent` attach.**

  **WO-22 amendment — a second, unshipped mechanism exists.** A ghost spawned
  with a hostile soul's `SharedSoulGuid` inherits that soul row's own
  `factionName` and was attacked by real guards within seconds, with **no
  native attach and no DLL injection**, and with no dependence on a donor NPC
  being loaded in the save (the GUID comes from table data, not save data —
  which dissolves the donor-soul fragility recorded in the README's aggro
  limits). Observed as a side effect of WO-22's brain testing; **not tested as
  a replacement for the shipped mechanism, and not wired into the mod.** Do not
  read this bullet as "aggro is closed" any more.
- **Aggro via Lua `AI.*` binds — WO-20, partially real, not sufficient.**
  Re-tested with a corrected method (real native addresses recovered via a
  Lua-closure walk, not a guessed call signature — `WO-20-aggro-findings.md`).
  `AI.AddPersonallyHostile`/`AI.IsPersonallyHostile` and
  `AI.SetAttentiontarget`/`AI.AddAggressiveTarget` write genuine, verified
  engine state (confirmed by independent getters, not fault-free returns).
  `AI.SetFactionOf` and `AI.CreateStimulusEvent` remain inert under every
  argument shape tried (4 and 5 variants respectively). **None of the
  working ones, alone or combined, caused a real NPC to move toward or
  attack a ghost** — writing this state is not sufficient to make an NPC act
  on it. **Consequence unchanged: replicated damage hurts NPCs but does not
  make them fight back**, and the native faction-attach mechanism is still
  the only proven lever for real aggro.

  **WO-25 amendments.** Three findings, live-verified 2026-08-06
  (`docs/WO-25-findings.md`):
  1. **The two Lua binds add nothing, isolated cleanly.** WO-24's Phase 3
     test was confounded (already-hostile soul). Re-run on a genuinely
     non-hostile commoner soul: `AddPersonallyHostile`/`SetAttentiontarget`
     write real, verified state but produce zero observable engagement
     (`AttentionTargetType`/`PeakThreatLevel` stuck at 0 over 65s). The
     soul-row `factionName` remains the only proven lever for real aggro.
  2. **A real essential-NPC protection exists and was live-verified against
     actual lethal damage.** `soul_vip_class_id` (`Libs/Tables/rpg/
     soul_vip_class.xml`) is a real field on every soul row — 95% of
     ~8,198 souls carry none, the rest carry graduated protection
     (`immortality`, `untouchable`, etc). Live A/B test: a ghost bound to a
     real quest NPC's soul (Petr Mailer, `vip_class_id=4`) survived 200
     lethal damage at 1 HP (`IsDead=false`); an identical hit killed an
     unprotected control NPC outright (`IsDead=true`). This is a genuine,
     working guardrail for any future aggro work, not just a data label.
  3. **Soul-row hostility (the WO-22/24 lead) is still not wired into the
     mod**, and shipping it as originally proposed hit a real design
     conflict: it requires swapping a ghost's `SharedSoulGuid` to a
     hostile-faction soul, which also destroys WO-20's deterministic
     face-roster appearance (no proven lever sets faction hostility
     independent of soul identity — `AI.SetFactionOf` remains confirmed
     inert). The project's actual long-term goal — connected players
     staying fully "Henry," cosmetically and functionally, with automatic
     reactive combat engagement rather than a manual toggle — needs a
     different technical approach than anything found across
     WO-20/22/24/25, and is its own future WO.

  **WO-26 amendments — the premise of most of the above is now wrong**
  (`docs/WO-26-findings.md`, live 2026-08-06):
  1. **The shipped default ghost already engages, reactively, with no toggle
     and no hostile faction.** Tested for the first time. A ghost spawned by
     `KCD2MP_SpawnGhost`'s exact current shape (roster `SharedSoulGuid`,
     `Civilians`, `aggroEnabled=false`, no `AI.*` binds) treats being attacked
     as a crime, arms itself unprompted, and took the human from **100 to 57
     HP in one exchange**. As an uninvolved bystander it engaged a hostile
     ghost, pursued it **340 m** and killed it (`IsDead=true`, read from the
     API). **WO-22's A2 gate ("the ghost fights back is not demonstrated") is
     superseded**, and WO-25's Phase 4 face/soul conflict is moot — it only
     arises if hostility must come from swapping `SharedSoulGuid`, and it does
     not. Untested clause: whether a ghost de-escalates after a fight ends.
  2. **A connected player cannot be Henry.** `Player` is a distinct class at
     three layers (entity class with its own `player.lua` and `type="Player"`,
     which `NPC.lua` lacks; `AIOBJECT_PLAYER`=100 vs `AIOBJECT_ACTOR`=5 live;
     soul class `player`, id 5, carried by exactly 3 shipped souls). A second
     `Player`-class entity **spawns malformed (no archetype, no faction) and
     crashed the game** within ~52 error frames — observed, BugSplat fired.
     The structural reason is `SoulList::PlayerSoul`, a **single read-only
     `Soul*`** holding `player_henry`, which Lua cannot reach. Do not
     re-derive this.
  3. **`AI.GetAttentionTargetType` / `AI.GetPeakThreatLevel` are not
     engagement indicators** and must not be cited as evidence again. Both
     read exactly 0 through genuine, damage-dealing combat. WO-25's Phase 2
     conclusion still stands on its no-movement/no-damage evidence.
  4. **"A soul-only ghost is byte-stationary" (WO-22) holds only while idle.**
     In combat it ranges hundreds of metres — a real, unmeasured conflict with
     `KCD2MP_InterpTick`'s 50 ms position stream, and the genuine remaining
     engineering problem here.

  **WO-27 amendment — what `mp_enable_aggro` actually does, live-verified
  in both states** (`docs/WO-27-findings.md`). The toggle does **not** gate
  the reactive combat above — that fires with `aggroEnabled=false`, as WO-26
  already showed. What it gates is the older, still-real WO-15/16/17
  mechanism: `SetFactionHostileAsync`, a native `SetParent` attach of the
  ghost onto a real hostile bandit faction (`trosecko_enemies_bandits_
  prepadeniAmbushers_group1`), triggered whenever a ghost lands or receives a
  hit while the toggle is on, held ~20s, then released. Confirmed by reading
  `FactionNode/Parent/Name` before and after an identical hit in both toggle
  states: off leaves the ghost's ordinary faction untouched; on flips it to
  the bandit faction. **Effect on top of the always-on reactive combat:**
  proactive, faction-wide recognition — any nearby NPC hostile to that
  faction, not just whoever the ghost is already fighting, can target it
  unprompted. Off, engagement stays limited to whoever directly attacks the
  ghost or is already fighting near it. The `DrawWeapon` cosmetic call
  (WO-17) remains gated the same way and is still cosmetic-only.
- **Attacker attribution.** `TakeDamage`'s `Attacker` parameter creates no
  combat history — `HasCombatHistoryWithSoul(player, 30s)` returned false after
  a hit landed.
- ~~**Faction manipulation.** `C_FactionBase::SetParent` corrupted the faction
  tree and crashed the game.~~ **FIXED, 2026-08-02 (WO-15 addendum).** The
  crash was a diagnosed calling-convention bug (a borrowed reference handed to
  a by-value parameter the callee destroys), not an inherent unsafety of the
  mechanism. Fixed and live-tested successfully (stable 4+ minutes, donor
  faction's own membership unharmed) — see `docs/WO-15-findings.md`'s
  addendum. **Still not wired into the mod's actual aggro path** — this
  proves the write is safe now, not that it produces aggro on its own (it
  needs a perceiving/"brained" ghost combined with it, untested together).
- **Retail build as a target.** Monolithic `WHGame.dll`, exports nothing, no
  reflection REST API. Modding Tools only — both players need that Steam entry.

---

## 5. Traps — every one of these cost real time here

**Native / reflection**

- A fault-free rttr `invoke` is **not** a successful one. It returns an *invalid
  variant* on argument mismatch, with no exception. Check `variant::is_valid`.
  This is `pcall` returning true, one layer down.
- `TakeDamage`'s third parameter is `Attacker` (`I_Soul*`), **not**
  `SuppressHitReaction`. Passing a bool there silently did nothing.
- **Never pass a borrowed reference to a by-value parameter that owns a
  resource** (`shared_ptr`, `CryStringT`, containers) — the callee destroys it.
  This released a faction object and crashed the game. Value types (floats,
  enums, raw pointers) are fine.
- **Immediate read-back is not verification** for state the game re-derives. The
  faction write read back correctly and was reverted minutes later.
- Pointer comparison cannot distinguish souls: the map stores `C_Soul*` while
  `PlayerSoul` returns an `I_Soul*` base subobject. Compare by GUID.
- Even GUID comparison is not enough for "is this the player" — a second soul
  named "Dude", with its own GUID, sits at the player's exact position.

**Lua sandbox**

- **This mod's embedded Lua uses 32-bit float numbers, not doubles.**
  `tostring()` on a value above ~16.7M (2^24) prints in scientific notation
  with low digits already gone, and integer-ish arithmetic (hashing,
  checksums) silently corrupts above that range — a `%2147483647` string
  hash collapsed 7 of 9 test inputs onto the same output. Keep any Lua
  integer arithmetic's intermediate values under 2^24; see `WO-20-faces.md`.

**Pipe / IPC**

- A duplex pipe used from two threads **requires `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` on both
  handles**. Without it Windows serialises I/O per handle and a write queues
  behind a parked read forever. A user-mode lock cannot fix this.
- Check the result of every write. A discarded `WriteFile` return made a blocked
  write look delivered.
- A narrow `catch` filter on a background task is a diagnostic dead end — the
  reader died silently and looked identical to "the DLL never wrote".

**Process / tooling**

- **A stale injected DLL keeps the pipe** (`ERROR_PIPE_BUSY`) and its sampler
  keeps running. Test a rebuilt DLL against a **restarted game**, or you are
  testing the old one. This produced two false negatives.
- A REST container read without `?depth=` serialised **658 MB** once. Always
  `?depth=0` or `?depth=1`.
- `Soul.Revive()` undoes a death; `SetState(health, …)` does not.
- `System.Guid` needs no byte reordering — its layout matches the game's CryGUID
  in memory. Only the *text* form needs field reversal.
- **PowerShell variables are case-insensitive**: `$ack` shadows `$ACK`, `$pong`
  shadows `$PONG`. Cost two false failures.
- `[Guid]::new($arr[1..16])` throws — a range index yields `Object[]` and selects
  the string overload. Cast to `[byte[]]`.

---

## 6. Environment

- **Launch via the KCD2 Modding Tools Steam entry**
  (`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\KCD2Mod`). The reflection REST API on
  `localhost:1403` and the exported module DLLs exist only there.
- **.NET SDK is user-scope, not on PATH:**
  `$env:DOTNET_ROOT = "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotnet-sdk8"; $env:PATH = "$env:DOTNET_ROOT;$env:PATH"`. Stay on net8.0.
- **MSVC Build Tools installed**, not on PATH; `native\Build-Native.ps1` finds them.
- **No Python** — moot as of WO-35: the Flask master server is gone, replaced
  by `dotnet/KcdMp.MasterServer/`.
- **One machine, one copy of the game, no second player.** Synthetic TCP peers
  and the pipe test cover everything except a real second client. This is why
  every feature needs a headless test path.

---

## 7. Still open

- **`Test-AppearanceE2E.ps1` fails: 2 of 5 item classes never equip.** Newly
  visible, 2026-08-07. That script had drifted to protocol version 5 against a
  relay speaking 6 and so could not handshake at all; nobody had run it since
  the bump. With the pin fixed (see below) it now runs the full flow and
  reproducibly leaves `belt_2slot` (`7da54a04-…`) and `GambesonShort02`
  (`993d563a-…`) unequipped, at the default settle window and a shortened one
  alike — so it is not the documented "equips take a while under load"
  flakiness. **Not a WO-28 regression**: that diff contains no changes to the
  appearance path. Leading hypothesis, untested: the slot exclusivity the
  script's own header already documents for `Hood08`, whose shape would have
  changed in WO-22 when ghosts started inheriting their roster soul's outfit.

- **Protocol version pins in `tools\` are now derived, not copied.**
  `tools/ProtocolVersion.ps1` reads `Protocol.Version` out of `Protocol.cs`;
  every synthetic-peer script dot-sources it. Three of eleven had silently
  drifted (`Test-AppearanceE2E` 5, `Test-CombatE2E` 3, `Bot-DiceOpponent` 4).
  The relay refuses a mismatch outright, so a drifted pin does not degrade — it
  cannot connect, and reads like "the relay is down". Scripts that deliberately
  test a mismatch express it as `$PROTOCOL_VERSION + 1`, so they keep working.
  **Do not reintroduce a literal version byte in a new script.**

- **Launcher end-to-end run.** The wiring itself is **done** — commit `54af330`
  rewrote `LaunchGame` to start the Modding Tools build, wait for `WHGame.dll`,
  run the injector, check its exit code, and then start `KcdMpClient.exe`.

  What remains is **verification**: the launcher has never been run against a
  real game launch. Its pieces are exercised individually by
  `tools\Test-CombatOutbound.ps1`, but its own sequencing has only been
  reviewed. The `WHGame.dll` wait is a reasoned choice, not a measured one.

  *(This bullet previously claimed the launcher still booted the base game and
  never started the agent. That was already false when written — `54af330`
  precedes the commit that added this document.)*

- **Master-server chain (WO-35): done and live-verified, unlike the rest of
  this bullet list.** The never-run Flask service is gone, replaced by a
  community-contributed `dotnet/KcdMp.MasterServer/` (WebSocket announce, not
  HTTP polling — see `docs/MASTER-SERVER.md`). Adopting it required rewriting
  both ends that talked to the old contract: the relay's
  `MasterRegistrationService` → `MasterAnnounceService`, and the launcher's
  `NetService.GetServersFromMasterAsync`/DTOs. Verified live: the real master,
  the real relay, and the real launcher `NetService` code all run together —
  announce, live player-count update, and delisting within ~1s of the relay
  disconnecting, all observed, not inferred. See `docs/WO-35-findings.md`.
- **Dice (WO-5/WO-6) real-game verification.** The relay/protocol/engine layers
  are proven headless (`Test-Dice.ps1`, the Farkle xUnit suite), and the
  agent-side IPC was verified with two real `KcdMpClient.exe` processes and a
  synthetic wire peer. The Blazor-rendering gap is now moot — that window is
  deleted (WO-6). Still not verified: **how the in-game overlay actually looks
  on screen** (`mp_dice_demo` drives a full scripted match for exactly this
  review — see the "NEEDS THE GAME" runbook at the end of `WO-6-progress.md`),
  which of the native KCD2 panels render when pushed from outside their normal
  context (`tools/Probe-Visual.ps1`), the in-game keybinds (action names are
  unverified guesses, same caveat as WO-2's accept/decline — but now gated on
  the board being open, so a wrong guess is a dead key rather than a stray
  action), and a real two-human match at real latency. See `WO-5-dice.md`,
  `WO-6-overlay-design.md`, `WO-6-visual-capability.md`.

- **Dice tables are identifiable — this one is CLOSED, not open.** Entity class
  `DiceInteractor` (registered by `Scripts.pak`'s `Entities/DiceInteractor.ent`).
  `System.GetEntitiesByClass("DiceInteractor")` returned nine world tables with
  the player standing 1.2 m from one and the next 512.9 m away. No proximity
  heuristic and no config-flag fallback was needed.
- **Ghost brains — RESOLVED in WO-22, and the old trade-off was never real.**
  `esModularBehaviorTree` is inert and `"IdleSeq"` names no behaviour tree
  anywhere in the shipped game data (WO-21, reconfirmed twice in WO-22 against
  extracted retail `Scripts.pak` and a retail Lua state dump). The
  `""`-versus-`"IdleSeq"` trade-off this entry used to describe was a
  distinction without a difference.

  What actually gives a ghost a brain is a **soul**: `brain_id` is a column on
  the soul row in `Libs/Tables/rpg/soul__*.xml`. `XGenAIModule.SpawnEntity`
  takes a **top-level** `SharedSoulGuid` (its parameter table is flat — there
  is no `Properties` key in it), and passing the GUID nested inside
  `Properties`, as this mod did until WO-22, bound no soul at all.
  `KCD2MP_SpawnGhost` now passes it correctly. Ghosts get their roster soul's
  face, faction identity, reputation log, combat level and brain — and recover
  from being knocked unconscious, which is A1 fixed.

  `SchedulerProxyName` is deliberately **not** passed: it is what would make a
  ghost select its own activities and walk away from where `KCD2MP_InterpTick`
  puts it. It is not needed for the recovery fix. `ForceMount` is unaffected —
  re-tested against a real horse in every spawn shape. See
  `docs/WO-22-brain-lead.md`.
- **`kdcmp.lua` is a ~2,400-line monolith.** Much of the ghost plumbing is
  redundant if the DLL ever renders players directly. The animation tables and
  speed thresholds are empirical data — port them, never regenerate them.

## 8. Reading order for a new session

1. **this document** — current state and corrections
2. `VERSIONING.md` — **read before touching `VERSION` or building a release.**
   Version numbers are the user's to choose; no session increments them.
3. `HANDOFF-WO4-combat.md` — shared combat: architecture, how to run and test
3. `WO-5-dice.md` — dice (Farkle): architecture, how to run and test, what is
   and is not verified
4. `NATIVE-PLUGIN-findings.md` — capability evidence, the RTTR ABI
5. `ARCHITECTURE-shared-world.md` — where the shared/private boundary falls
6. `LAUNCHING.md` — launch path and the remaining launcher gaps
7. the original brief — intent and the unstarted work orders, read *last* and
   with §2–§5 corrected by this document

`git log` records reasoning and **retractions**, not just changes. Several
commits explicitly retract earlier claims; read those before trusting an older
statement.
