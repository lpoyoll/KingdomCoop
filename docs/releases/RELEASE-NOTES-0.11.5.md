# KCD2 Multiplayer 0.11.5 — Release notes

Since `0.10.0`. Full detail lives in the [README](../../README.md) and `docs/`.

## What's New

- **Ghosts have real, distinct faces** — 48 real NPC faces, deterministically
  assigned per player, instead of one generic look for everyone.
- **Other players' health shows on their nameplate**, driven by their own
  game only.
- **Death is shared.** Everyone sees `[dead - reloading]`; the player reloads
  their own save, same as single-player.
- **NPCs can now hurt a remote player**, not just their local stand-in.
  *Built and safeguarded, but not yet tested across two real machines.*
- **Launcher refresh**: new look, a REPORT BUG button, and a warning if you
  and your peer are on mismatched versions.
- **Mixed-version sessions degrade gracefully** instead of breaking — health
  just won't show for the outdated side.
- Ghosts have always fought back on their own (self-defense, joining nearby
  fights) — this is the first release to actually say so.
- `mp_enable_aggro` clarified: fighting back was never gated by this toggle;
  it only widens *who else* notices the fight.

## Bug Fixes

- **Save reload used to break multiplayer for everyone else** — you'd stop
  transmitting and vanish, and everyone else's ghost body would disappear
  from under their nametag. This affected *any* reload, not just death.
  Fixed; both recover on their own in ~14s.
- **Reconnecting no longer leaves a duplicate ghost behind.**
- **The launcher no longer lets two agents run for one player** — the cause
  of ghosts appearing "attached" to a player.
- **A knocked-out ghost gets back up now** instead of staying unconscious
  forever.

## Investigated, not shipped

- Running on retail (no Modding Tools) via its RemoteConsole port — works,
  but depends on another modder's tooling; not pursued without permission.
- Forcing the native dice minigame's roll outcome — still not achievable.
- Whether a connected player can be Henry instead of a ghost — no; closed.

## Known limits

- **Fighting the same NPC together works, but each of you is fighting your
  own copy of it.** There's no single shared version deciding who it's mad
  at. Damage and death carry over between you (enough hits between you both
  and it dies for everyone), but whether it turns on your friend too is up
  to *their* local copy noticing the fight, not something sent over the
  network.
- A ghost's own attacks aren't replicated back to its owner.
- Nothing here has been tested with two real players on two real machines.
