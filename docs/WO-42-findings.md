# WO-42 — the native combat-animation route, disassembled

Reverse-engineering session, 2026-08-21. **No mod code was written or changed
this session** (that is WO-43's job, deliberately separated). Everything below
comes from static disassembly of this machine's own installed binaries with
Ghidra 12.1.3 headless; the game was never launched and no process was touched.

Read this together with `docs/WO-40-findings.md` (Phase 1 / Phase 6 — the
scripting-layer attempts already closed out) and
`docs/WO-42-libkcd2-reference.md` (the community claims this session was
measuring against). Where this document and that reference disagree, **this
document wins** — it is derived from the binaries actually installed here.

**This session resolves WO-41's stated blocker.** `docs/WO-41-progress.md`
("The real difficulty, stated honestly") stopped at: the combat-attack
construction path is built by free dispatch functions that are not exported, so
"reaching them means **disassembling CombatModule.dll to re-derive the
equivalents**". That is exactly what this session did. WO-41's independent
version finding (Modding Tools 1.5.5 vs retail 1.5.6, non-monolithic vs
monolithic) is reproduced here in §1 from a second direction.

**Evidence classes used below**, per this project's convention:

- **observed** — read directly out of the disassembly/binary this session.
- **read-but-unrendered** — a mechanism traced in code but never executed in a
  running game, so its *behaviour* is unverified.
- **inferred** — a reading that goes a step beyond what the bytes say; every one
  is labelled.

Reproduction assets (kept, reusable): `native/ghidra_scripts/DumpWo42Anchors.java`,
`DumpWo42Fns.java`, `DumpWo42Asm.java`, `DumpWo42Callers.java`, `DumpWo42Vtbl.java`.

## 0. The one fact that made this session cheap, and changes the method

The community reference resolves addresses by byte-pattern scanning because
retail is a stripped monolith. **This install is not that.** Three properties of
the Modding Tools build, all **observed**:

1. **The engine is split into per-subsystem DLLs.** `CombatModule.dll` (8.93 MB)
   and `AnimationModule.dll` (2.15 MB) exist as separate images, instead of
   retail's single `WHGame.dll`.
2. **Asserts and trace logging are compiled in, with `__FUNCTION__` strings and
   full source paths retained.** Every function of interest carries a literal
   copy of its own fully-qualified name:

```
1805AA700  "wh::combatmodule::C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack::EnterImpl"
1805AA690  "d:\buildagent\work\7ffb7f119a855ecb\code\game\modules\combatmodule\Actions\CombatActorActionSyncAttack.cpp"
180169B08  "wh::animationmodule::C_AnimationController::QueueAction"
```

3. **MSVC RTTI is present**, so Ghidra's RTTI analyzer recovers real class names
   and vftable labels (`wh::combatmodule::C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack::vftable`,
   `IAction::vftable`, `TAction<SAnimationContext>::vftable`, …).

**Method consequence, and it is the important one:** identification here is
*not* pattern matching. A function that references the string
`"wh::animationmodule::C_AnimationController::QueueAction"` **is** that function
— the compiler put its own name inside it. Every address in this document is
anchored either to such a string or to an RTTI-recovered vftable, and then its
**body was read** to confirm it does what the name says. That is the
"verify, don't assume" bar the WO set, met by construction.

**Correction to a WO-40 assumption.** WO-40 Phase 1 recorded that "our Modding
Tools build exports mangled C++ symbols, so these entry points may be directly
`GetProcAddress`-able here — strictly better than retail's address library."
**That is false for these functions.** Full export dumps (`dumpbin /exports`):
`AnimationModule.dll` exports **90** names, `CombatModule.dll` exports **63**,
and the great majority of both are `boost::optional<bool>` template noise.
`QueueAction` is not exported. No combat action class is exported. The only
export in scope is `??0C_AnimationController@animationmodule@wh@@QEAA@XZ` (the
controller's default constructor, RVA `0x20150`) — which is not what we need to
call. **WO-43 must resolve by module base + RVA, not by name.** §7 gives the
verification recipe that makes that safe.

---

## 1. Phase 1 — the version baseline: **MISMATCH. Everything was re-derived.**

| | Modding Tools (this project's target) | Retail (what the reference documents) |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\KCD2Mod` | `…\KingdomComeDeliverance2` |
| `KingdomCome.exe` FileVersion | **1.5.5.0** (observed) | **1.5.6.0** (observed) |
| Build preset (`whdlversions.json`) | `kcd2_release_1_5_moddingtools_pc` | `kcd2_release_1_5_game_pc` |
| Binary config | `ReleaseSteamLTO_DLL`, build `1166656_117`, 2026-04-16 | `MasterMasterSteamPGO`, build `1308617`, 2026-06-15/19 |
| Link shape | per-module DLLs (`CombatModule.dll`, `AnimationModule.dll`, …) | monolithic `WHGame.dll` |
| Asserts / `__FUNCTION__` strings | present | (retail: PGO master, stripped) |

The mismatch is not a point release — it is a **different build number, a
different optimisation configuration, and a different link topology.** The
reference's addresses are offsets into a `WHGame.dll` that does not exist in
this install. **Nothing was carried over numerically.** Everything in §2–§6 was
re-derived from these binaries.

What the reference *did* buy us — and it was worth real time — is the map: the
class names, the existence of a paired attack/hit mechanism, and the
`m_pSyncPartner` idea. Those told us where to look. Three of its structural
claims came back confirmed, two came back wrong:

| Reference claim | Verdict here | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `QueueAction(IAction&, float, bool)` takes a constructed action, not a name | **CONFIRMED** (observed) | §2 |
| `QueueAction` at animation-controller **vtable slot [1]** | **CONFIRMED** (observed) | §2.2 |
| `IActionController::Queue` at **vtable+0x98** | **CONFIRMED** (observed twice, independently) | §2.3 |
| `IAnimatedCharacter::GetActionController()` at slot **[37]** | **WRONG for this build** | it is at byte offset **+0x130** = slot **[38]** (observed) |
| `C_CombatActorActionAttack` is **`sizeof 0xB0`** | **WRONG for this build** | it is **`0xC0`** (observed at the allocation site, §4.3) |
| A `SyncAttack`/`SyncHit` pair linked by a back-reference | **CONFIRMED, and both ends located** | §5.1 |

---

## 2. Phase 2.1 — `QueueAction`: address, calling convention, body

### 2.1 Identity and address

**`wh::animationmodule::C_AnimationController::QueueAction` = `AnimationModule.dll`
RVA `0x00020410`** (image base 0x180000000 → `0x180020410`). **Observed.**

Anchors, all three inside the function body:

| RVA of anchor | Content |
|---|---|
| `0x169B08` | `"wh::animationmodule::C_AnimationController::QueueAction"` |
| `0x169B40` | `" %s.QueueAction[%d](%s) -> %s [GlobalTags=%s]"` |
| `0x169B80` | `"…\animationmodule\AnimationController\AnimationController.cpp"`, line `0x34` (52) |

### 2.2 It is vtable slot [1] — and of *which* subobject

`C_AnimationController`'s constructor (RVA `0x20150`, an exported symbol, so
this part is certain) installs **two** vptrs:

```
180020170  LEA RAX,[0x180168758]      ; C_AnimationController::vftable  (A)
180020177  MOV [RDI], RAX             ;   -> object + 0x00   (primary)
18002017E  LEA RAX,[0x180168720]      ; C_AnimationController::vftable  (B)
180020189  MOV [RDI+0x40], RAX        ;   -> object + 0x40
```

Table **B** at RVA `0x168720` is the `I_AnimationController` interface table.
Its slots (observed):

| offset | slot | target |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | [0] | `0x18002F274` |
| **+0x08** | **[1]** | **`0x180020410` — QueueAction** |
| +0x10 | [2] | `0x180021080` |
| +0x18 | [3] | `0x180021060` |
| +0x20 | [4] | `0x180020CF0` |
| +0x28 | [5] | `0x180020C30` |
| +0x30 | — | the next table's RTTI complete-object locator, so this interface has exactly 6 virtuals |

`0x180020410` is referenced from **exactly one** vtable slot in the whole module:
`0x180168728` = table B + 0x08. (The other four data references to it — at
`0x1801F8DB8`, `0x1801B1278`, `0x1801B128C`, `0x1801B129C` — are 4-byte-aligned
32-bit RVAs: `.pdata`/EH `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` entries, not vtables. Checked by
dumping those regions; they decode as packed RVA pairs, e.g.
`0x000204CC`/`0x00020410`.)

**So `I_AnimationController` is the base subobject at `C_AnimationController + 0x40`,
and `QueueAction` is slot [1] of it.** This also resolves an oddity in the
decompilation: `QueueAction` reads `[this - 8]`, which is only sane because
`this` is the +0x40 subobject and `object + 0x38` is the member immediately
before it. Consistent, not a decompiler artefact.

### 2.3 Calling convention — register-level, from the instruction stream

```
180020410  PUSH RBX / R13 / R14 / R15 ; SUB RSP,0xD8
180020439  MOV  R13, RCX              ; RCX = this  (the +0x40 subobject)
18002043C  MOVZX EBX, R9B             ; R9B = bool  restartInstalled
180020447  MOVAPS XMM6, XMM2          ; XMM2 = float time   (saved across the log calls)
18002044A  MOV  R14, RDX              ; RDX = IAction* action
...
180020637  MOVAPS XMM2, XMM6          ; restored immediately before the real call
18002064E  MOV  AL, 0x1               ; returns bool, unconditionally true
180020676  RET
```

```c
// CONFIRMED, observed at register level
bool __fastcall C_AnimationController_QueueAction(
        void*  this_,             // RCX  — the I_AnimationController subobject (object + 0x40)
        void*  action,            // RDX  — IAction*
        float  time,              // XMM2 — the game passes -1.0f
        bool   restartInstalled); // R9   — the game passes false
```

Standard MS x64. The `float` really is in **XMM2** (argument slot 3), not R8 — an
implementer who declares the third parameter as `int`/`void*` will corrupt the
call. This is the single most easily-got-wrong detail in the whole document.

### 2.4 What the body actually does

```c
IActionController* ac = this_->[+0x10] /*IAnimatedCharacter*/ ->vtbl[0x130]();  // GetActionController
if (!ac) return true;

int status = action->[+0x28];
if (status == 0 || status == 4) {
    // ---- logging block only (builds two CryStrings, then trace::Write) ----
    //   reads: ac->vtbl[0xB0]()          context; its +0x10 feeds the global-tags string
    //          action->[+0x38]           fragmentID
    //          action->[+0x3C .. +0x4F]  20-byte TagState
    //          action->[+0x24]           the "[%d]" (priority — see §3)
    //          action->vtbl[0xB0]()      action name
    // ---- the real work ----
    ac->vtbl[0x98](ac, action, time);           // IActionController::Queue(IAction&, float)
}
else if (restartInstalled && status == 2) {     // 2 == already installed
    uint32 f = action->[+0x2C];
    action->[+0x2C] = f | 0x80;
    if (!(f & 0x40)) {
        action->[+0x2C] = f | 0xC0;
        void* obj = ((void**)action->[+0x30])->vtbl[0x20]();   // rootScope -> action controller
        obj->vtbl[0xA0](obj, action);                          // IActionController::Requeue(IAction&)
    }
}
return true;
```

**Confirmed derived vtable offsets** (observed):

| interface | offset | meaning | how confirmed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IAnimatedCharacter` | **+0x130** | `GetActionController()` | used identically in two independent functions (`0x20410` in AnimationModule, `0xF3C00` in CombatModule) |
| `IActionController` | **+0x98** | `Queue(IAction&, float)` | the sole real call in the success path, in both those functions |
| `IActionController` | **+0xA0** | `Requeue(IAction&)` | the restart path; adjacent to Queue |
| `IActionController` | **+0xB0** | context getter (result's `+0x10` feeds the global-tags string) | both functions |
| `IAction` | **+0x08 / +0x10** | AddRef / Release (`_smart_ptr` interface) | the SyncHit factory's tail, §5.1 |
| `IAction` | **+0xB8** | release/destroy virtual | every release site: `if (--refcount < 2) action->vtbl[0xB8]()` |

**Nothing about `QueueAction` is speculative.** It is a thin wrapper: resolve the
action controller off the animated character, filter on the action's status, log,
and forward to `IActionController::Queue`.

---

## 3. `IAction` / `TAction<SAnimationContext>` — the confirmed memory layout

This is the layout an implementer needs, and it is **observed from the constructor
itself**, which Ghidra identified by RTTI (it writes `IAction::vftable` and then
`TAction<SAnimationContext>::vftable`):

- `CombatModule.dll` RVA **`0x10BA90`** — 6-parameter form
- `AnimationModule.dll` RVA **`0x100250`** — 7-parameter form (one extra field)

Both are per-module copies of the same template body (LTO/DLL split).

```c
// AnimationModule RVA 0x100250 — the fuller of the two
void* TAction_ctor(void* this_,       // RCX
                   uint32 priority,   // EDX
                   uint32 fragmentID, // R8D
                   const void* tags20,// R9   — pointer to 20 bytes of TagState
                   uint32 flags,      // [rsp+0x20]
                   uint32 arg6,       // [rsp+0x28]
                   uint32 scopeMask); // [rsp+0x30]  (7-arg form only)
```

| offset | size | set to | reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | 8 | `IAction::vftable`, overwritten at the end with `TAction<SAnimationContext>::vftable` | vptr |
| +0x08 | 8 | 0 | |
| +0x10 | 4 | 0 | |
| +0x14 | 4 | `0xBF800000` = **-1.0f** | a float (name *inferred*) |
| +0x18 | 4 | `arg6` | |
| +0x1C | 4 | 0 | |
| +0x20 | 4 | `0xFFFFFFFF` | |
| **+0x24** | 4 | `priority` | **priority** — the `[%d]` in `QueueAction`'s log |
| **+0x28** | 4 | 0 | **status** (`0` = none; `QueueAction` accepts 0 and 4; `2` = installed) |
| +0x2C | 4 | `flags` | flags (`QueueAction`'s restart path sets bits 0x40/0x80) |
| +0x30 | 8 | 0 | **root scope / director** (used by the Requeue path) |
| **+0x38** | 4 | `fragmentID` | **FragmentID** |
| **+0x3C** | 20 | `memcpy` from `tags20` (two qwords + one dword) | **TagState — 0x14 bytes** |
| +0x50 | 4 | `0xFFFFFFFE` | |
| +0x54 | 4 | `scopeMask` (7-arg form) / 0 (6-arg form) | name *inferred* |
| **+0x58** | 4 | 0 | **intrusive refcount** (`_smart_ptr`) |
| +0x5C | 4 | `0x3F800000` = 1.0f | |
| +0x60 | 4 | `0x3F800000` = 1.0f | |
| +0x68 | 8 | a static empty-array sentinel | **named-parameter array** (§6.3) |
| +0x70, +0x78 | 8+8 | 0 | |
| +0x80 | 4 | 0 | |
| +0x88 | 8 | a second static sentinel | second container |

**`TagState` is 20 bytes (0x14) in this build.** Corroborated three independent
ways: the constructor copies exactly 20 bytes; `QueueAction`'s logging block
reads exactly `MOVUPS xmm0,[action+0x3C]` plus `MOV eax,[action+0x4C]`; and
`C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction` reads the identical five dwords.

**`+0x24` is definitively priority**, not something else — the constructor takes
it as the parameter that the call sites pass literal `5`, `6`, `7` for, and
`QueueAction` logs that same field as `QueueAction[%d]`.

---

## 4. Phase 2.2–2.4 — the combat action classes, constructors and factories

All in `CombatModule.dll`, image base `0x180000000`.

### 4.1 Address table (every row **observed**, anchor named)

| RVA | What | Anchor used to identify it |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0F3C00` | `C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction(this, _smart_ptr<C_CombatAnimAction>&, float)` | own `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5CB3D0` + fmt `"Combat %s.QueueAnimAction[%d](%s) -> %s [GlobalTags=%s]"` |
| `0x0F26F0` | `C_CombatAnimAction` constructor, **sizeof `0x1A8`** | writes `C_CombatAnimAction::vftable`; size read at its allocation sites |

| `0x054FA0` | `C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack::ExitImpl` | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5AA740` |
| `0x055430` | `C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack` member that **creates and pairs the SyncHit** (§5.1) | sole non-data caller of the SyncHit factory |
| `0x088990` | **factory + constructor** for `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit`, **sizeof `0xD8`** | writes the three `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit::vftable`s; size at its own inline allocation |
| `0x055640` | `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit` destructor | same vptrs, written immediately at entry |
| `0x055710` | `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit::EnterImpl` — **Queue inlined** | both `__FUNCTION__` strings (`0x5AA7E0`, `0x5AE790`) |
| `0x056420` | `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit::ExitImpl` | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5AA818` |
| `0x084D20` | **factory + constructor** for `C_CombatActorActionAttack`, **sizeof `0xC0`** | writes the four `C_CombatActorActionAttack::vftable`s |
| `0x084F30` | a second `C_CombatActorActionAttack` factory variant | also calls the helper ctor `0x61470` |
| `0x044140` | `C_CombatActorActionAttack` destructor | vptrs at entry |
| `0x044300` | `C_CombatActorActionAttack::EnterImpl` | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5A9450` |
| `0x0450D0` | `C_CombatActorActionAttack::ExitImpl` | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5A9598` |
| `0x044AB0` | `C_CombatActorAnimatedAction<AttackParams,1,…>::Queue` — **a real separate function here**, not inlined | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5ACFF0`; called from `0x044749` inside `EnterImpl` |
| `0x061470` | `C_CombatActionHelperAttack` constructor, **sizeof `0x50`** | writes `C_CombatActionHelperAttack::vftable`; size at all five call sites |
| `0x061890` | `C_CombatActionHelperAttack::EnterImpl` | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5AB290` |
| `0x0813F0`, `0x084470` | `C_CombatActionHelperAttack::FillSyncHitInfo` (two template instantiations) | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5ACCC0` |
| `0x092520`, `0x0955C0`, `0x0457C0` | `C_CombatActionHelperAttack::FillTimeToHit` instantiations | `__FUNCTION__` @ `0x5ACE40` |
| `0x0CBAD0` | installs a `std::function` delegate at `C_CombatAnimAction + 0x120` | body reads `+0x158`, writes `+0x120` |
| `0x0CB740` | installs a `std::function` delegate at `C_CombatAnimAction + 0x0A0` | body reads `+0x0D8`, writes `+0x0A0` |
| `0x655430` | the float constant **`-1.0f`** (`0xBF800000`) passed as `time` | read out of the file |

Relevant vftable RVAs (RTTI-recovered labels): SyncAttack `0x5C0E60` / `0x5C10D0`
/ `0x5C1098` / `0x5C0E18`; SyncHit `0x5C0B60` / `0x5C0D98` / `0x5C0DD0`; Attack
`0x5C3A58` / `0x5C3A90` / `0x5C3AD0` / `0x5C3B18`; `C_CombatActionHelperAttack`
`0x5BFEF0` and `0x5BFF08`; `C_CombatActionEarlyExitHelper` `0x5BFF70`;
`I_CombatActionHelperAttackOwner` `0x5C41C0`.

**`C_CombatActionEarlyExitHelper` has no separate constructor function** — it is
**constructed inline** (five stores) inside both the SyncAttack constructor and
the SyncHit factory. **sizeof `0x18`.** Initialisation, verbatim (observed):

```c
void* h = alloc(0x18);
h[0x00] = C_CombatActorObject::vftable;
h[0x08] = actor;
FUN_1800723A0(actor, h);          // RVA 0x723A0 — registers h with the actor
*(uint8*)(h + 0x10) = 0;
h[0x00] = C_CombatActionEarlyExitHelper::vftable;   // RVA 0x5BFF70
*(uint32*)(h + 0x14) = 0;
```

### 4.2 Class layouts

All **observed** from the constructors, then cross-checked against the field
reads in the corresponding `EnterImpl`.

**`C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack` — sizeof `0xC0`**

| offset | contents |
|---|---|
| +0x00 | vptr → vftable `0x5C0E60` |
| +0x10 | vptr → vftable `0x5C10D0` |
| +0x14 … +0x88 | the `TAction<SAnimationContext>` base fields of §3 |
| +0x40 | `C_CombatActorAction` state (ctor sets **2**) |
| +0x44 | priority (ctor sets 0) |
| +0x48 | `wh::framework::C_ActionDirector*` (taken from `actor + 0x2E0`) |
| +0x58 | `S_CombatActorActionSyncAttackParams::vftable` — the params are embedded here |
| **+0x60** | **attack descriptor** (params field 1) — written by the factory |
| **+0x68** | **hit descriptor** (params field 2) — written by the factory |
| +0x70 | vptr → vftable `0x5C1098` (the `C_CombatActorObject` chain) |
| **+0x78** | **`I_CombatActor*`** — the constructor's second argument |
| +0x8C | flags (factory sets from the request; `\|0x1000` if no hit descriptor, `\|4` conditionally) |
| **+0x90** | **`C_CombatAnimAction*`**, refcounted; 0 until `EnterImpl` |
| +0x98 | vptr → vftable `0x5C0E18` (the `I_CombatActionHelperAttackOwner` chain) |
| **+0xA0** | **`C_CombatActionHelperAttack*`** — 0x50 bytes, ctor `0x61470(mem, actor, this+0x98)` |
| **+0xA8** | **`C_CombatActionEarlyExitHelper*`** — 0x18 bytes, inline |

**`C_CombatActorActionSyncHit` — sizeof `0xD8`**

| offset | contents |
|---|---|
| +0x00, +0x10, +0x68, +0x98 | the four polymorphic subobjects |
| +0x40 | state (**2**); +0x44 priority (0); +0x48 `C_ActionDirector*` |
| **+0x58** | **hit descriptor** — 0 in the factory, written by the pairing code |
| +0x60 | a bool, written by the pairing code |
| **+0x70** | **`I_CombatActor*`** — *the victim*, not the attacker |
| +0x84 | u32, 0 in the factory; overwritten by the pairing code |

| **+0xC8** | `C_CombatActionEarlyExitHelper*` |
| **+0xD0** | **raw back-pointer to the partner `C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack`** — 0 in the factory |

**`C_CombatActorActionAttack` — sizeof `0xC0`** (**not** the reference's `0xB0`)

Same shape as SyncAttack minus the sync machinery: +0x58 params vptr,
**+0x60 attack descriptor**, +0x68 u32 = `0x101` (the caller then writes bytes at
+0x68/+0x6A/+0x6B), +0x70 vptr, **+0x78 actor**, +0x8C flags,
**+0x90 `C_CombatAnimAction*`**, +0x98 vptr, +0xA0 = 0, +0xA8 = 0,
**+0xB0 `C_CombatActionHelperAttack*`**. No early-exit helper, no sync partner.

**`C_CombatAnimAction` — sizeof `0x1A8`**, constructor RVA `0x0F26F0`:

```c
// register-level, read off the call site at 0x180054820
void* CombatAnimAction_ctor(
        void*  this_,       // RCX  — freshly allocated 0x1A8 block
        void*  same,        // RDX  — the same pointer again; the body never reads it
        void*  actor,       // R8   — I_CombatActor*
        uint32 priority,    // R9D  — 5 for attack/sync-attack, 7 for sync-hit
        uint32 fragmentID,  // [rsp+0x20]
        const void* tags20, // [rsp+0x28]
        uint32 flags);      // [rsp+0x30] — the game passes 0
// body: TAction_ctor(this_, priority, fragmentID, tags20, flags, 0);
//       this_[+0x00]  = C_CombatAnimAction::vftable
//       this_[+0x90]  = 0 (u32);   this_[+0x98] = 0 (u8)
//       this_[+0xD8]  = this_[+0x118] = this_[+0x158] = this_[+0x198] = 0
//       this_[+0x1A0] = 0
//       this_[+0x94]  = flags
//       this_[+0x9C]  = *(u32*)(*(void**)(actor + 0x2D8) + 0x30)
```

The four zeroed qwords at 0x40-byte stride are the "callable" slots of **four
`std::function` delegates at +0x0A0, +0x0E0, +0x120, +0x160** (each 0x40 bytes,
its callable pointer at +0x38 within). Confirmed by the two installer helpers:
`0x0CB740` writes +0x0A0 (reads +0x0D8) and `0x0CBAD0` writes +0x120 (reads
+0x158). **Observed.**

Field **`+0x84 … +0x93` (16 bytes) of `C_CombatAnimAction` is an asset GUID** the
engine fills in — *not* the constructor — and it is load-bearing; see §5.3.

### 4.3 Where the sizes come from

Every `sizeof` above is read directly off the allocation instruction immediately
preceding the constructor call, e.g.

```
1800547B0  MOV RAX,[0x18080F930]     ; the module allocator
1800547BF  MOV ECX,0x1A8             ; <-- sizeof(C_CombatAnimAction)
1800547C4  CALL RAX
```

and for the actions: `0xC0` at `0x18005C08B` (SyncAttack factory), `0xD8` at
`0x1800889B0` (SyncHit factory), `0xC0` at `0x180084D30` (Attack factory), `0x50`
for the attack helper, `0x18` for the early-exit helper. **Observed.**

### 4.4 `I_CombatActor` member offsets used by these paths

Every row below is a field the traced code actually dereferences, so each is
**observed** — but the *names* are read off how the field is used, and are
therefore **inferred** except where a call resolves the type unambiguously.
This table is what WO-43 will actually need to navigate from an actor pointer.

| offset | what the code does with it | reading |
|---|---|---|
| +0x2D8 | `(*(void***)(actor+0x2D8))->vtbl[0x490]()` → the `%s` in every "Actor: %s" log; `->vtbl[0x2D0]()` → an `IAnimatedCharacter`; `+0x30` read as a u32 into `C_CombatAnimAction+0x9C` | the owning entity / animated entity |
| +0x2E0 | passed as the first argument of the base `C_Action` ctor; used as the `C_ActionDirector*` argument to `wh::framework::C_ActionDirector::SetAction` | **`C_ActionDirector*`** (type confirmed by the imported symbol) |
| +0x2F0 | `+0x1118` → the current opponent's actor; `+0xF40` → a flags object (`vtbl[0x08]()`); `+0x40`, `+0xD28`, `+0xE28`, `+0xD68`, `+0x80`, `+0x100`, `+0x140`, `+0x540`, `+0x5C0`, `+0x580`, `+0xB18`, `+0xF40` all read | the combat state block |
| +0x300 | first argument of `FUN_180161CF0` during Enter | — |
| +0x478 | passed to `FUN_180374CD0` during attack selection | — |
| **+0x490** | **the `C_CombatAnimActionManager`** that `QueueAction` is called on | confirmed by the call site |
| +0x498 | `+0x08` → an `I_CombatActor*` (the victim, in the pairing path); `+0xB8` → an attack-selection object | an action/attack owner |
| +0x4B0 | target of `FUN_1800E4170` in the post-queue block | — |
| +0x4D0 | `FUN_1800E07B0(that, 6)` after queueing | — |
| +0x4D8 | `FUN_1800E80E0(that)` during attack selection | — |

**Not checked here:** WO-41's note that `C_Actor::m_pCombatActor` sits at
`C_Actor + 0x278` and `C_CombatActor::m_pActionManager` at `+0x3A8`. Those are
`libKCD2` structural claims about *different* classes (`C_Actor` in
`EntityModule.dll`), and this session did not open `EntityModule.dll`. They
remain unverified. What *is* verified is that once you hold an `I_CombatActor*`,
the animation manager is at `+0x490` and the director at `+0x2E0`.

## 5. Phase 2.3 / Phase 3 — the pairing, and the real construction sequence

### 5.1 The pairing mechanism, fully traced

`CombatModule.dll` RVA **`0x055430`** — a member of
`C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack`, identified by its field accesses (`+0x60`,
`+0x68`, `+0x78`, `+0xA8`, `+0xB0`, `+0xB8` — exactly the SyncAttack layout) and
by being the sole non-data caller of the SyncHit factory. Reconstructed body,
**observed**:

```c
bool SyncAttack__CreateAndPairSyncHit(C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack* self)   // RCX
{
    if (self->hitDescriptor /*+0x68*/ == nullptr)
        return true;                                   // nothing to pair

    void* combat   = *(void**)((char*)self->actor /*+0x78*/ + 0x2F0);
    void* opponent = *(void**)((char*)combat + 0x1118);
    if (!opponent)
        return true;                                   // no victim -> no pair

    uint32 fA = (*(void***)((char*)combat + 0xF40))->vtbl[0x08]();   // attacker flags
    self->[+0xB8] = 1;                                 // "sync hit created"

    void*  owner  = *(void**)((char*)opponent + 0x498);
    void*  victim = *(void**)((char*)owner + 0x08);    // the victim's I_CombatActor
    uint32 fB     = (*(void***)((char*)*(void**)((char*)self->actor + 0x2F0) + 0xF40))->vtbl[0x08]();

    _smart_ptr<C_CombatActorActionSyncHit> hit;
    MakeSyncHit(&hit, victim);                          // RVA 0x088990 — allocates 0xD8

    hit->[+0x58] = self->hitDescriptor;                 // the SHARED hit descriptor
    hit->[+0x60] = (uint8)((fB >> 2) & 1);
    hit->[+0x84] = (fA & 0x80) ? 0x100u : 0u;
    hit->vtbl[0x08](hit);                               // AddRef
    hit->vtbl[0x10](hit);                               // Release

    // store into the attacker's partner slot, releasing whatever was there
    if (self->[+0xB0]) self->[+0xB0]->vtbl[0x10]();
    self->[+0xB0] = hit;                                // <-- attacker -> hit action

    if (fB & 8)
        FUN_1800DC060(*(void**)((char*)opponent + 0x2F0), 0x20);

    C_ActionDirector* dir = *(C_ActionDirector**)((char*)opponent + 0x2E0);
    hit->vtbl[0x08]();                                  // AddRef for the call
    bool ok = wh::framework::C_ActionDirector::SetAction(dir, &hit);   // imported symbol
    hit->vtbl[0x10]();                                  // Release
    if (!ok) { self->[+0xB0] = nullptr; hit->vtbl[0x10](); return false; }

    hit->[+0xD0] = self;                                // <-- hit action -> attacker

    if (**(int**)((char*)self->attackDescriptor /*+0x60*/ + 0x128) == g_someId)
        self->earlyExitHelper /*+0xA8*/ ->vtbl[0x38](self->earlyExitHelper, &nullSmartPtr);

    return true;
}
```

**This is the `m_pSyncPartner` mechanism, both ends located:**

| direction | field | kind |
|---|---|---|
| attacker → victim's hit action | `C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack + 0xB0` | owning `_smart_ptr` |
| victim's hit action → attacker | `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit + 0xD0` | raw back-pointer |

And the load-bearing detail the reference does not contain: **the hit action is
not queued by the attacker.** It is handed to the *victim's own*
`wh::framework::C_ActionDirector` (`victim's I_CombatActor + 0x2E0`) via
`C_ActionDirector::SetAction`. That director then enters it, and *its*
`EnterImpl` (`0x055710`) performs its own `QueueAction`. **The two animations
correspond because both sides are driven from the same shared hit descriptor
(`SyncAttack+0x68` → `SyncHit+0x58`) through two independent directors** — not
because one side drives the other's animation directly.

Cross-check that this reading is right: `SyncAttack::EnterImpl` uses `+0xB0` as
`partner->[+0x70]`, and `+0x70` is exactly where the SyncHit factory stores its
`I_CombatActor*`. Two independently-derived layouts agree. **Observed.**

### 5.2 The construction sequence — `C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack::EnterImpl`

RVA `0x0543D0`, with `C_CombatActorAnimatedAction<…>::Queue` inlined. This is the
WO's Phase-3 deliverable: a real, in-context call site in the game's own compiled
combat code. Annotated reconstruction, **observed** (register-level details taken
from the disassembly, not the decompiler's parameter guesses):

```c

```

**The two lifecycle delegates, resolved** (observed):

| slot | target | body |
|---|---|---|
| `anim + 0x120` (installer `0x0CBAD0`) | `0x054F50` | `FUN_180054210(self)` then `wh::framework::C_ActionDirector::OnActionDone(self->[+0x48], self->vtbl[0x80](self), 2)` — the **finished** hook |
| `anim + 0x0A0` (installer `0x0CB740`) | `0x054F20` | `FUN_1800F2CE0(anim, 6)` — the **entered** hook |

### 5.2b `C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction` (RVA `0x0F3C00`)

```c
void C_CombatAnimActionManager__QueueAction(
        void*  self,                                  // RCX
        _smart_ptr<C_CombatAnimAction>* sp,           // RDX  (by reference)
        float  time)                                  // XMM2
{
    void* animChar = (*(void***)((char*)*(void**)self + 0x2D8))->vtbl[0x2D0]();
    IActionController* ac = animChar->vtbl[0x130]();          // GetActionController
    if (ac && ((*sp)->[+0x28] == 0 || (*sp)->[+0x28] == 4)) {
        /* the same logging block as C_AnimationController::QueueAction:
           reads (*sp)->[+0x38] fragmentID and (*sp)->[+0x3C..+0x4C] TagState */
        ac->vtbl[0x98](ac, *sp, time);                         // Queue(IAction&, float)
    }
    // then releases sp's reference: if (--(*sp)->[+0x58] < 2) (*sp)->vtbl[0xB8]()
}
```

Note the ownership rule an implementer must respect: **`QueueAction` consumes one
reference.** The call site at `0x180054A85` does `INC.LOCK [anim+0x58]`
immediately before the call and a matching decrement immediately after; the
manager itself drops one. **Observed.**

`C_CombatActorActionSyncHit::EnterImpl` (`0x055710`) and
`C_CombatActorAnimatedAction<AttackParams,…>::Queue` (`0x044AB0`) are
instruction-for-instruction the same idiom with different constants:

| class | priority passed to the anim-action ctor | descriptor field | anim-action field |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C_CombatActorActionAttack` | **5** | `+0x60` | `+0x90` |
| `C_CombatActorActionSyncAttack` | **5** | `+0x60` | `+0x90` |
| `C_CombatActorActionSyncHit` | **7** | `+0x58` | `+0x88` |

Three independent instances of the identical construction sequence, each reading
`fragmentID` from `descriptor + 0x0C` and the 20-byte `TagState` from
`descriptor + 0x24`, all queueing with `time = -1.0f`. That triple agreement is
why §3's layout can be stated as confirmed rather than inferred.

### 5.3 The one hard dependency that constrains WO-43

`C_CombatActionHelperAttack::FillSyncHitInfo` (`0x0813F0` / `0x084470`):

```c
void FillSyncHitInfo(C_CombatActionHelperAttack* self,  // RCX
                     C_CombatAnimAction* anim,          // RDX
                     int hitIndex,                      // R8D
                     I_CombatActor* victim)             // R9
{
    *(int*)((char*)self + 0x0C) = hitIndex;
    uint8 guid[16];
    memcpy(guid, (char*)anim + 0x84, 16);              // <-- an asset GUID on the anim action
    void* meta = LookupMannequinMeta(&g_metaTable /*0x18080CC30*/, guid);
    if (!meta) {
        trace::Write(1, …, "…CombatActionHelperAttack.h", 0xF5, "…::FillSyncHitInfo",
          "Error: Meta data for asset is missing in the table. Resave mannequine "
          "database to update the table content (%s, %s, %d, GUID: %s)");
        return;
    }
    void* hitInfo = FUN_1802AA830(meta, hitIndex);
    if (!hitInfo) {
        trace::Write(1, …, line 0xFD, "Error: Cannot find hit info with index %d. "
          "Resave mannequine database to update the table content (…)");
        return;
    }
    if (!victim) return;
    /* … resolves the victim's own animation set and computes the paired hit … */
}
```

**Read this as a constraint, not trivia.** The sync-hit half of the mechanism is
driven by **metadata baked into the Mannequin database (ADB) by
`C_MannequineGenerator`** — the exported class
`??0C_MannequineGenerator@generator@combatmodule@wh@@QEAA@XZ` at CombatModule RVA
`0x2AA940` — keyed by a **16-byte asset GUID at `C_CombatAnimAction + 0x84`**.
That GUID is **not** written by the anim-action constructor (§4.2 lists every
field the constructor touches; `+0x84` is not among them); it is filled in by the
engine when the fragment resolves.

Consequence for WO-43, stated plainly: **a hand-constructed `C_CombatAnimAction`
will queue and animate, but a hand-constructed *sync pair* will only produce
correct paired timing if the fragment it resolves to carries ADB metadata the
generator already baked.** Playing an arbitrary fragment name with no such
metadata will log the "Meta data for asset is missing" error and fall through
with no hit info. This is **observed** as a code path; it is
**read-but-unrendered** as a runtime behaviour.

---

## 6. The cheapest confirmed route: the game's own `PlayAnim` test command

Separate from the combat classes, `AnimationModule.dll` contains a complete,
minimal, self-contained "build an action and queue it" sequence — a shipped test
command. It is the shortest confirmed path from *a fragment name and tag string*
to *a playing animation*, and it needs none of §4/§5.

- `AnimationModule.dll` RVA **`0x12EF20`** = `wh::animationmodule::C_PlayAnim::Execute`
- registered in RTTR as `wh::tests::PlayAnim`, described in the binary as
  `"Play given animation fragment. Stops immediately. Use just for low level testing!"`,
  parameters `"Name of an entity to be tested."` and
  `"Name of the fragment to be played in format: 'FragmentId, tag1+tag2'"`, plus
  optional `AlignEntityName` / `TagPoint1`.
- the assert string that anchors it:
  `"[Test] Check 'actor->GetAnimationController()->QueueAction(*action.get())' has failed: "`
  (RVA `0x186F60`).

### 6.1 The sequence (observed)

```c
void C_PlayAnim__Execute(C_PlayAnim* self)   // RCX
{
    // 1. name -> entity -> I_AnimatedActor
    entityId = C_EntityHelper::Resolve(self->entityName /*self+0x70*/);
    I_AnimatedActor* actor = GetGameIface()->[0x188]->vtbl[0x18](entityId);
    if (!actor) { fail("[Test] Check 'actor' has failed: "); return; }

    // 2. the actor's class / anim-database key
    void* actorClass = actor->vtbl[0x498](actor);
    if (!actorClass) { fail("… 'actorClass' … Could not get actor class"); return; }

    // 3. load the animation database
    void* x      = GetGameIface()->[0x08]->vtbl[0xB0]();
    void* y      = x->vtbl[0x18](x);
    void* animDB = y->vtbl[0x20](y, *(void**)((char*)actorClass + 0x28));
    if (!animDB) { fail("… 'animDB' … Could not load animation database"); return; }

    // 4. parse "FragmentId, tag1+tag2" -> fragmentID + 20-byte TagState
    uint32 fragmentID = 0xFFFFFFFF;
    uint8  tags20[20] = {0};
    ParseFragmentSpec(animDB, self->fragmentSpec /*self+0x78*/, &scratchString);  // RVA 0x12DB00

    // 5. allocate and construct a C_CallbackAction  (sizeof 0x268)
    void* a = alloc(0x268);                                        // RVA 0x1A410
    TAction_ctor(a, /*priority*/ 6, fragmentID, tags20,
                 /*flags*/ 0, /*arg6*/ 0, /*scopeMask*/ 0xD888);    // RVA 0x100250
    *(uint32*)((char*)a + 0x258) = 0;
    *(void**)a = C_CallbackAction::vftable;
    // zero the "callable" slot of each of the seven std::function delegates:
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x0C8) = 0;   // delegate 1
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x108) = 0;   // 2
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x148) = 0;   // 3
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x188) = 0;   // 4
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x1C8) = 0;   // 5
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x208) = 0;   // 6
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x248) = 0;   // 7
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x250) = 0;
    *(void**)((char*)a + 0x260) = 0;
    FUN_18012D830(a);                                              // RVA 0x12D830, extra init
    ++*(int*)((char*)a + 0x58);                                    // AddRef

    // 6. OPTIONAL: set a named QuatT parameter (only when AlignEntityName is given)
    //    SetParam("TargetPos", quatT)   -- see §6.3

    // 7. QUEUE
    I_AnimationController* ctrl = actor->vtbl[0x2F0](actor);        // GetAnimationController()
    bool ok = ctrl->vtbl[0x08](ctrl, a, -1.0f, false);              // QueueAction, slot [1]
    if (!ok) fail("[Test] Check 'actor->GetAnimationController()->QueueAction(*action.get())' has failed: ");

    // 8. release
    if (--*(int*)((char*)a + 0x58) < 2) a->vtbl[0xB8](a);
}
```

### 6.2 What this independently confirms

- `I_AnimatedActor::GetAnimationController()` is at **actor vtable +0x2F0**.
- `QueueAction` is **slot [1] (+0x08)** of the returned pointer — matching §2.2's
  vtable dump from a completely different direction (RTTI tables vs. this call).
- the argument shape `(action, -1.0f, false)` and the `bool` return.
- `sizeof(C_CallbackAction) = 0x268`, with **seven `std::function` delegates**
  laid out from +0x90 at 0x40 stride (callable slots at +0xC8, +0x108, +0x148,
  +0x188, +0x1C8, +0x208, +0x248) — the byte-level version of WO-40's note that
  `C_CallbackAction` carries "fragmentID +0x38, tags, priority, lifecycle
  delegates".
- **A fragment name plus tag string can be turned into `(fragmentID, TagState)`
  by the engine itself** — `AnimationModule.dll` RVA `0x12DB00`, given the
  actor's animation database. WO-43 does not have to compute Mannequin IDs by
  hand.

### 6.3 `IAction::SetParam` — the named-parameter array, byte-mapped

The optional align-target branch exposes the container at `action + 0x68`:

- entries are **0x20 bytes** each; the count lives at `array - 4`.
- entry layout: `[0x00] uint32 key`, `[0x04] float quat[4]`, `[0x14] float vec3[3]`
  — i.e. a `QuatT`.
- the key is a **CRC32 of the lowercased parameter name**; the code inlines the
  loop over `"TargetPos"` against the table at `0x1801689F0`, then stores `~crc`.
- growth is `FUN_18013F930(&action->[+0x68], newCount)` — RVA `0x13F930`.

Useful because Mannequin alignment/target parameters are exactly what a
cross-machine swing needs in order to place a hit.

### 6.4 A lead, explicitly not a claim

`C_PlayAnim` is **RTTR-registered** — the binary carries
`rttr::detail::constructor_wrapper<C_PlayAnim, …, as_std_shared_ptr, …>` for
zero-, two-, and three-`CryStringT<char>` argument forms, a `property_wrapper`
for a `CryString` member, a `destructor_wrapper`, and `type_converter`s to
`wh::tests::I_TestCommand` / `C_TestCommandBase` / `C_OneshotCommandBase`.
**Observed** in `.rdata`.

That means the same reflection surface this project already drives over
`localhost:1403` and `native/KCDMP/rttr_abi.cpp` *may* be able to construct and
run `wh::tests::PlayAnim` with no injected call at all. **This was not tested —
the game was never launched this session.** It is a concrete, cheap first probe
for WO-43 and nothing more than that until it runs.

---

## 7. Practical notes for WO-43

1. **Resolve by module + RVA.** `GetModuleHandleA("AnimationModule.dll")` /
   `"CombatModule.dll"` — both are real, separately-loaded images in this build —
   then add the RVA. Do **not** plan on `GetProcAddress` (§0).
2. **Verify before calling.** Because these are hardcoded RVAs against one local
   build, verify rather than trust. The cheapest strong check exploits §0: each
   target function contains a `LEA reg,[rel32]` pointing at its own
   `__FUNCTION__` string. For `QueueAction` that instruction sits at `fn + 0x1A9`
   (`48 8D 05 <rel32>`); resolve `fn + 0x1A9 + 7 + rel32` and `strcmp` against
   `"wh::animationmodule::C_AnimationController::QueueAction"`. A match proves
   both that the address is right *and* that it is the right function — far
   stronger than a prologue byte pattern. Prologue bytes are recorded below
   anyway, but they are generic MSVC prologues and must not be relied on alone.
3. **Get the float right.** Third argument, **XMM2**. The game passes `-1.0f`.
4. **Respect the refcount.** `action + 0x58`; `AddRef` = `vtbl[0x08]`,
   `Release` = `vtbl[0x10]`, destroy = `vtbl[0xB8]`; and
   `C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction` consumes one reference.
5. **Ladder of increasing ambition** — each rung separately confirmed above:
   - **rung 0 (no injection):** try `wh::tests::PlayAnim` over the existing
     RTTR/REST surface (§6.4). Unverified, but free.
   - **rung 1:** replicate §6.1 — build a `C_CallbackAction`, parse the fragment
     spec with `0x12DB00`, queue via `actor->vtbl[0x2F0]()->vtbl[0x08]()`.
     Everything on this rung is confirmed, and the game's own code does exactly
     it.
   - **rung 2:** replicate §5.2 — a `C_CombatAnimAction` (0x1A8) built from a
     real attack descriptor and queued through the actor's own
     `C_CombatAnimActionManager` at `actor + 0x490`. Needs a valid descriptor
     pointer.
   - **rung 3:** the paired route of §5.1. Needs a live opponent
     (`actor+0x2F0 → +0x1118`), the victim's `C_ActionDirector`
     (`victim + 0x2E0`), and — per §5.3 — ADB metadata for the chosen asset.
6. **Prologue bytes** (first 24, for cross-checking that an RVA landed in a
   function at all):

7. **Every RVA in this document is valid only for the binaries fingerprinted in
   §1** — Modding Tools 1.5.5.0, `ReleaseSteamLTO_DLL` build 1166656_117;
   `AnimationModule.dll` 2,145,792 bytes, `CombatModule.dll` 8,928,768 bytes. If
   either file's size changes, re-run the pipeline: the scripts in
   `native/ghidra_scripts/` reproduce all of it in roughly ten minutes.

### 7.1 Reproducing the pipeline

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot"
$g    = "<extracted ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC>"
$proj = "<a scratch directory>"
$bin  = "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\KCD2Mod\Bin\Win64ReleaseSteamLTO_DLL"

# one-time import + full auto-analysis (RTTI analyzer included)
#   AnimationModule.dll ~55 s, CombatModule.dll a few minutes
& "$g\support\analyzeHeadless.bat" $proj wo42 -import "$bin\AnimationModule.dll" `
    -analysisTimeoutPerFile 3600

# string-anchored identification: needles -> (string, referencing function, decompilation)

    -postScript DumpWo42Anchors.java "<outDir>" "QueueAction" "C_PlayAnim"
```

`DumpWo42Fns.java <out> <depth> <addr…>` decompiles addresses (optionally their
callees); `DumpWo42Asm.java <out> <addr…>` dumps raw disassembly with resolved
string/symbol comments (use this, not the decompiler, for anything ABI-shaped);
`DumpWo42Callers.java <out> <addr…>` lists callers; `DumpWo42Vtbl.java <out>
<count> <addr…>` dumps vtable slots with resolved targets.

Note for future sessions: `-analysisTimeoutPerFile` is the correct flag name;
`-analysisTimeout` is silently misparsed as another positional import path.

---

## 8. Where solid ground ends

**Confirmed by disassembly (observed):** every address, size, field offset,
vtable offset, calling convention and control-flow claim in §1–§6, plus the
pairing mechanism of §5.1 and the construction sequences of §5.2 and §6.1.
Phase 3 did not stall — a real in-context combat call site was found and fully
traced, three times over (attack, sync-attack, sync-hit), and a second, simpler,
fully-traced call site was found in the animation module.

**Read-but-unrendered (traced in code, never executed):** all of it, as runtime
behaviour. Nothing in this document has been observed running. In particular:
that a hand-built action queued this way actually *renders* a swing; that
`C_ActionDirector::SetAction` succeeds on a ghost/puppet actor rather than only
on a real brained combatant; and that a mod-supplied fragment carries the ADB
metadata §5.3 needs.

**Inferred, and flagged as such:**

- **The names of three fields.** `IAction + 0x14` and `+0x50`/`+0x54` are read as
  "a float initialised to -1.0f" and "scope mask" by analogy with public
  CryEngine Mannequin headers. The *values* and *offsets* are observed; the
  *names* are inferred, and nothing in this document depends on them.
- **`C_CombatAnimActionManager::QueueAction`'s first indirection.** The body
  reads `*(void**)self` and then `+0x2D8` off that. Whether `self` is the manager
  holding an actor pointer at offset 0, or something else, was not pinned down —
  and it does not matter, because the call site (`0x180054A79`) simply loads the
  manager from `actor + 0x490`, which *is* observed.
- **The `enterArg` parameter of `EnterImpl`** is forwarded to the attack helper's
  `vtbl[0x38]` and never otherwise examined; its type was not determined.
- **The 16-byte blob** written into `helperAttack + 0x28` in §5.2 step 5 is
  assembled from a literal `0x01000001` and a shifted flag word; the individual
  bit meanings were not decoded.

**Deliberately not attempted:** nothing was written to the game, no process was
opened, no mod code was changed, and the Mannequin database was not modified.
Licensing posture is unchanged from WO-40 Phase 1 — the community reference was
read as documentation, and every fact above was independently re-derived from
binaries this machine already owns.

---

## 9. De-risk assessment (added same session, after §8)

Two checks were run to size WO-43's risk before any code gets written. Both are
static — the game is still never launched.

### 9.1 Check 1 — the ADB metadata dependency: **not a blocker. It is shipped data, and it is complete.**

§5.3 flagged that sync-hit info depends on metadata "baked into the Mannequin
database". That framing was too pessimistic. The metadata is **not** opaque
binary inside an `.adb` — it is an ordinary Warhorse Tables XML, and the binary
names it outright. **Observed**, CombatModule string at RVA `0x5ACD00`:

> `"Warning for ViktorB: Please fill animation hit RPG for animation: %s,%s,%d (guid: %s), hit index: %d. These data can be filled in table 'combat_fragment_meta.xml'. See KCD2-A-8244."`

Backing code, all **observed**: `wh::combatmodule::C_CombatFragmentMetaDatabase`
(source `…\combatmodule\DB\Static\CombatFragmentMetaDatabase.cpp`), element type
`C_CombatFragmentMetaData` holding `std::vector<C_CombatHitInfo>`, persisted via
`wh::databasemodule::C_ObjectTreeDatabase<C_CombatFragmentMetaData, std::vector>::LoadFromXML / SaveToXML`.
The runtime table at `0x18080CC30` is populated by `FUN_1802B3720`; the lookup
`FUN_18008C810(&table, guid16)` inside `FillSyncHitInfo` reads it.

**The files, extracted and inspected from `Data\Tables.pak` (7.2 MB, 1738 entries):**

| file | size | entries |
|---|---|---|
| `Libs/Tables/combat/combat_fragment_meta.xml` | 176,009 | **766** `CombatFragmentMetaData`; 585 with at least one `CombatHitInfo`, 181 self-closing |
| `Libs/Tables/combat/combat_action_sync_attack.xml` | 812,456 | **470** rows |
| `Libs/Tables/combat/combat_action_sync_hit.xml` | 1,230,764 | **876** rows |
| `Libs/Tables/combat/combat_action_attack.xml` | 373,404 | **221** rows |
| `Libs/Tables/combat/combat_action_fragment_id_mapping.xml` | 20,855 | **114** rows |

Shape of a metadata entry, verbatim:

```xml
<CombatFragmentMetaData GUID="03f0183b-88be-3866-9fd7-22cb42a2e75b"
                        AnimDatabaseId="20967892" ObstacleTestEnabled="false">
  <CombatHitInfo BodySubpartId="55" AttackCoef="1" HandSlot="0" />
</CombatFragmentMetaData>
```

**The join coverage — the number that settles the risk:**

| descriptor table | distinct `mn_fragment_guid` | present in `combat_fragment_meta.xml` | of those, carrying `CombatHitInfo` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `combat_action_sync_attack` | 470 | **470 (100 %)** | **470 (100 %)** |
| `combat_action_attack` | 221 | 18 | 18 |
| `combat_action_sync_hit` | 876 | 107 | 0 |

**Every shipped sync-attack has its metadata row, and every one of those rows
carries hit info.** The asymmetry is exactly what the code predicts:
`FillSyncHitInfo` is a method of `C_CombatActionHelperAttack`, which lives on the
**attacker** (`SyncAttack+0xA0`, `Attack+0xB0`), so it looks up the *attacker's*
anim-action GUID. Victim-side (`sync_hit`) rows have no reason to be in the table
and mostly are not; unpaired `combat_action_attack` rows likewise.

**Verdict: rung 3 is not data-blocked for any attack the game itself ships.** It
would be blocked only for a *new* fragment a mod authored, which needs a row
added to `combat_fragment_meta.xml` — an ordinary, moddable Tables edit, not a
database resave. §5.3's warning stands only for that case, and should be read
with this section.

### 9.2 The unexpected payoff — the descriptors are shipped, readable data

Worth more to WO-43 than the risk answer itself. What
`SyncAttack + 0x60` / `+ 0x68` point at is a row of these tables, and every row
carries its Mannequin coordinates **in exactly the format `ParseFragmentSpec` —
and therefore `wh::tests::PlayAnim` — already accepts.** A real human
sync-attack row, verbatim:

```
mn_fragment_id          = "CombatAttackSyncGen"
mn_tags                 = "l_halberd+r_halberd+clinch1+eZ1+aZ2+attack_special+oppMale"

`mn_fragment_id` plus `mn_tags` **is** the `'FragmentId, tag1+tag2'` string. So
**rung 1 can play the game's real combat swings with the game's real tags**, read
straight out of `Tables.pak`, without constructing a single combat class. That
collapses most of rung 2's value into rung 1. The per-row timings
(`attack_time_to_hit`, `animation_duration`) are also exactly what a wire
protocol needs in order to schedule a remote swing.

Fragment vocabulary actually shipped (human class `1578932418`; counts are rows):

| table | top `mn_fragment_id` values |
|---|---|
| `sync_attack` | `CombatAttackComboGen` 158, `CombatAttackComboDeathGen` 82, `CombatStopMaster` 75, `CombatStealthAttackSuccess` 50, `CombatAttackSyncGen` 33, `CombatRiposteSyncGen` 23, `HorseCombatAttackSync` / `HorseCombatAttackSyncFail` 14 each |
| `sync_hit` | `CombatHitComboGen` 232, `CombatHitComboDeathGen` 232, `CombatStopSlave` 99, `CombatHitSyncGen` 93, `CombatStopDeathSlave` 78, `CombatStealthHitSuccess` 51, `CombatHitSyncDeathGen` 34 |
| `attack` (unpaired) | `CombatAttackSpecialGen` 84, `FreeAttack` 50, `CombatAttackGen` 41, `CombatAttackRiposteGen` 24, `CombatAttackMercy` 17 |

Class hashes: **`1578932418` = human** (451 of 470 sync-attacks, 822 of 876
sync-hits, 719 of 766 metadata rows); `20967892` = Dog; `1008263269` and
`474619276` are two further small sets. `AnimDatabaseId` in the metadata table and
`actor_class_hash` in the descriptor tables are the same identifier space —
**observed**: the Dog rows carry `actor_class_hash="20967892"` and their metadata
rows carry `AnimDatabaseId="20967892"`.

`combat_action_fragment_id_mapping.xml` additionally maps `action_type_id` to
`fragment_id` (114 rows, e.g. `0 → CombatHitMovement`, `3 → CombatAttack`), with a
`sync_hit` boolean per row.

### 9.3 Check 2, first pass — the exports (superseded by §9.5, which closes it)

`EntityModule.dll` is far richer in exports than the animation and combat
modules: **827 export lines**, including a usable entry chain (**observed**):

| export | RVA | note |
|---|---|---|
| `?m_Instance@C_EntityModule@entitymodule@wh@@0PEAV123@EA` | `0x12E5B10` | **the singleton pointer itself is exported** — `C_EntityModule* m = *(C_EntityModule**)(base + 0x12E5B10)` |
| `?I@C_EntityModule@entitymodule@wh@@…` | — | the singleton accessor |
| `?GetPlayerActor@C_EntityModule@entitymodule@wh@@UEBAPEAVC_Actor@23@XZ` | `0x71B330` | `C_Actor* GetPlayerActor() const` |
| `?GetPlayer@…`, `?GetScriptBindHuman@…`, `?GetScriptBindActor@…` plus ~120 further `C_EntityModule` getters | — | all name-resolvable |

**But `C_Actor` itself exports zero members.** So the last hop —
`C_Actor` → `I_CombatActor*` — is not name-resolvable, and WO-41's
`C_Actor::m_pCombatActor @ +0x278` (a libKCD2 claim) remains **unverified**.

The anchor that settles it is located: **`wh::entitymodule::C_Actor::InitCombatActor`,
`__FUNCTION__` string at EntityModule RVA `0xD43A30`** — the function that creates
and stores the combat actor will show the real member offset. `EntityModule.dll`
(20 MB) was still auto-analysing when this section was written; finishing it is
the same one-command pipeline as §7.1. **This is the one open item, and it is a
ten-minute job, not a research risk.**

Two further leads found in `EntityModule.dll` while looking — both **observed**
(string/RTTI anchored), neither followed yet:

- **`PlayAnim`** as a plain Lua method-name string at RVA `0xE9FB98`, adjacent to
  `wh::entitymodule::C_ScriptBindHuman::SetAnimMotionParam` at `0xE9FE40`, i.e.
  inside the `C_ScriptBindHuman` registration block. Its xref leads to the native
  implementation of `human:PlayAnim(fragment, tags)` — the call WO-40 already
  proved **renders** a Mannequin fragment on a ghost. Reading it yields the game's
  own entity→animation-controller walk *and* how it turns a tags string into a
  `TagState`, from a class reachable through an exported getter
  (`GetScriptBindHuman`). Probably the highest-value remaining read.
- **`C_ActorActionCombat`** (EntityModule) carries pointer-to-member types
  `void (C_ActorActionCombat::*)(I_CombatActor&, const int&, const _smart_ptr<I_CombatActorAction>&)`
  and `(I_CombatActor&, E_CombatActorStateId::Type, …)`, mirroring the descriptors
  on `C_CombatActorActionAttack` in CombatModule. That makes it the **bridge that
  accepts an already-constructed `I_CombatActorAction`** — a higher-level
  insertion point than queueing the anim action directly.

### 9.4 Revised risk picture for WO-43

| rung | risk before this assessment | after |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — RTTR `wh::tests::PlayAnim` | unknown | unchanged: free to try, needs the game running |
| 1 — build `C_CallbackAction`, queue it | low | **lower, and much more valuable** — §9.2 supplies the real combat fragment IDs and tag strings, so rung 1 can render actual swings rather than placeholders |
| 2 — `C_CombatAnimAction` via the actor's manager | "needs a valid descriptor pointer" | descriptors are **shipped, enumerable XML** (§9.2); the remaining unknown is only the runtime pointer to a loaded row |
| 3 — the paired sync route | thought to be data-gated | **not data-gated** for shipped attacks (§9.1); the real remaining gates are a live opponent, the victim's `C_ActionDirector`, and whether `SetAction` accepts a ghost/puppet actor |
| all rungs | needed a verified entity→`I_CombatActor*` path | **closed** in §9.5 — call `C_Actor::GetOrCreateCombatActor`, EntityModule RVA `0x92260`. WO-41's `+0x278` is wrong; the field is `+0x300`, and using the call makes the offset unnecessary |

§9.5 and §9.6 (written after this table) close check 2 and add a shorter rung-1
route than §6.1: a single virtual call, `C_Actor` vtable `+0xE48`, taking
`(const char* fragment, const char* tags)`.

### 9.5 Check 2, completed — the entity → `I_CombatActor*` path is **closed**, and WO-41's offset is wrong

`EntityModule.dll` finished analysing (20 MB, ~9 min). Results, all **observed**.

**The headline: `C_Actor::m_pCombatActor` is at `+0x300`, not `+0x278`.**
WO-41's note (a libKCD2 structural claim) is **wrong for this build**, and using
it would have dereferenced garbage.

Two functions establish it, and one of them makes the offset unnecessary:

**`C_Actor::GetOrCreateCombatActor` — EntityModule RVA `0x92260`.** This is the
local equivalent of the retail `GetOrCreateCombatActor` that WO-41 said would
have to be re-derived. Reconstructed, **observed**:

```c
I_CombatActor* C_Actor__GetOrCreateCombatActor(C_Actor* self)   // RCX
{
    if (!self->vtbl[0x988](self)) return nullptr;      // "can this actor have a combat actor"
    if (self->[+0x300] == nullptr) {
        void* cls = self->vtbl[0x498](self);           // GetActorClass()
        if (cls->vtbl[0x28](cls)) {                    // the class says combat-capable
            self->[+0x300] =
                GetGameIface()->[0x100]                // the combat module interface
                    ->vtbl[0x58](combatModule, self);  // CreateCombatActor(C_Actor&)
            if (C_Actor__InitCombatActor(self)) {      // RVA 0x92310
                FUN_1800923D0(self);
                FUN_1800D3460((char*)self + 0xF0, self->[+0x300]);
            }
        }
    }
    return self->[+0x300];
}
```

**`C_Actor::InitCombatActor` — EntityModule RVA `0x92310`** (anchored by its own
`__FUNCTION__` string at RVA `0xD43A30`, source `…\entitymodule\Actor\Actor.cpp`
line `0xC42`):

```c
bool C_Actor__InitCombatActor(C_Actor* self)          // RCX
{
    if (self->[+0x300]) {
        if (!self->[+0x300]->vtbl[0x2E0]()) {         // the combat actor's own init/validate
            trace::Write(1, 0x10, "…Actor.cpp", 0xC42,
                         "wh::entitymodule::C_Actor::InitCombatActor",
                         "Combat actor init failed for actor '%s'",
                         self->vtbl[0x490](self));    // GetName()
            GetGameIface()->[0x100]->vtbl[0x68](combatModule, &self->[+0x300]);  // destroy
            self->[+0x300] = nullptr;
        }
    }
    return self->[+0x300] != nullptr;
}
```

Derived facts (**observed**):

| thing | value |
|---|---|
| `C_Actor::m_pCombatActor` | **`+0x300`** (written, read and returned across the two functions above) |
| `C_Actor` vtable `+0x490` | `GetName()` |
| `C_Actor` vtable `+0x498` | `GetActorClass()` |
| `C_Actor` vtable `+0x988` | a combat-capability predicate |
| combat module interface | `GetGameIface() + 0x100` |
| combat module vtable `+0x58` | `CreateCombatActor(C_Actor&)` → `I_CombatActor*` |
| combat module vtable `+0x68` | destroy the combat actor (takes the slot address) |

**The round trip closes.** §4.4 recorded that CombatModule reaches an actor's
name as `(*(void***)(I_CombatActor + 0x2D8))->vtbl[0x490]()`. Here, from the
other module and the other direction, `C_Actor::GetName` is `C_Actor` vtable
`+0x490`. Same slot, same purpose, two binaries — so `I_CombatActor + 0x2D8`
points back at the `C_Actor`, and `C_Actor + 0x300` points forward at the
`I_CombatActor`. Neither offset was guessed.

**Recommended for WO-43: do not use `+0x300` at all.** Call
`C_Actor__GetOrCreateCombatActor` (RVA `0x92260`, `__fastcall`, `this` in RCX,
returns the pointer in RAX). It handles the not-yet-created case, which a raw
field read does not — and a puppeted ghost is exactly the case where the combat
actor may not exist yet.

**Getting the `C_Actor*` in the first place** — name-resolvable, no RVA guessing
(from the 827-entry export table):

```c
// EntityModule.dll
C_EntityModule*  m      = *(C_EntityModule**)(base + 0x12E5B10);  // ?m_Instance@... exported
C_Actor*         player = m->GetPlayerActor();                    // ?GetPlayerActor@... RVA 0x71B330
```

For a non-player actor, `C_ScriptBindHuman`'s own resolver is
**`FUN_180B3C2D0`** (RVA `0xB3C2D0`): `bind->[+0x70]->vtbl[0xC8]()` → an entity
lookup object → `->vtbl[0x18](entityId)` → candidate → `->vtbl[0x2A8](cand, 1)`
as a validity predicate. **Observed**, though the intermediate types were not
named.

### 9.6 Bonus from check 2 — `human:PlayAnim` bottoms out in **one virtual call**

The Lua bind WO-40 already proved *renders* a Mannequin fragment on a ghost was
traced to its native floor. Chain, all **observed**:

1. `C_ScriptBindHuman`'s constructor (RVA `0xB3A7E0`) registers the Lua name
   `"PlayAnim"` (string RVA `0xE9FB98`) with help text `"fragment, tag"` (string
   RVA `0xE9FBC8`), a marshalling trampoline `FUN_180B53E30` (RVA `0xB53E30`),
   and a pointer-to-member thunk at RVA `0xA3EFA8` whose bytes are
   `48 8B 01 FF A0 10 01 00 00` = `mov rax,[rcx]; jmp qword ptr [rax+0x110]`.
2. So the implementation is **`C_ScriptBindHuman` vtable slot `+0x110`** (table
   at RVA `0xE9AB38`, slot [34]) = **`FUN_180B3D5C0`**, RVA `0xB3D5C0`.
3. The trampoline pulls Lua arguments 1 and 2 as strings
   (`FUN_180B4EE50(handler, index, &out)`) and tail-jumps to it.
4. `FUN_180B3D5C0` is short and its whole payload is one call:

```c
void C_ScriptBindHuman__PlayAnim(void* self, IFunctionHandler* fh,
                                 const char* fragment, const char* tags)
{
    uint32 entityId = fh->vtbl[0x10](fh);            // the calling entity
    if (entityId) {
        C_Actor* actor = FUN_180B3C2D0(self, entityId);
        if (actor && actor->[+0x28]->vtbl[0x80]() != 0)   // a short, must be non-zero
            actor->vtbl[0xE48](actor, fragment, tags);    // <-- the entire mechanism
    }
    fh->vtbl[0x58](fh);                              // return nil
}
```

**`C_Actor` virtual slot `+0xE48` takes `(const char* fragmentName, const char* tags)`
and plays the fragment.** That is a *single virtual call* on a pointer WO-43 can
already obtain by name (§9.5) — no action object, no allocation, no `TagState`
construction. Combined with the real `mn_fragment_id` + `mn_tags` values from
§9.2, this is the shortest confirmed route to a real combat swing on a ghost, and
it is strictly simpler than replicating `C_PlayAnim::Execute` (§6.1).

**Boundary, stated precisely:** the *slot* (`+0xE48`) is confirmed from the call
site. **Which concrete class's vtable it resolves to was not pinned down** — a
probe of `C_NPCActor`'s primary table (RVA `0xE98340`, from its exported
constructor at `0xACBEE0`) at `+0xE48` landed on an unrelated getter, so the
receiver is not `C_NPCActor` at offset 0. That does not affect usability: WO-43
calls it virtually on whatever `C_Actor*` it holds, exactly as the game does.
Also **not** determined: what `actor->[+0x28]->vtbl[0x80]()` gates on — a
non-zero `short` is required, and a puppeted ghost failing that check is a
plausible failure mode worth logging on the first live attempt.
