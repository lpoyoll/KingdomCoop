.SYNOPSIS
    End-to-end appearance replication: synthetic peer -> relay -> agent -> ghost.

.DESCRIPTION
    Plays the part of a second player without needing one, the same trick
    Test-CombatE2E.ps1 uses. A synthetic TCP client handshakes with the relay,
    sends one Position packet (so the running agent spawns a real ghost NPC
    for it via KCD2MP_SpawnGhost -- appearance has nothing to apply to until a
    ghost exists), then sends an Appearance packet naming real item-class
    GUIDs -- armor and one weapon (WO-10). The running agent receives it over
    the relay exactly as it would from a real peer, and applies it to the
    synthetic ghost through the native EquipmentManager reflection calls
    proven in WO-9 Phase 0 (armor) and WO-10 (weapons, identical mechanism,
    confirmed live: EquipItem/UnequipItem/CreateItems do not care whether an
    item class is armor or a weapon).

    Verified through the debug REST API: the ghost's own
    EquipmentManager.EquippedArmorsByClassId AND EquippedWeaponsByClassId
    must contain the pushed classes afterward. This is the "two-agent local
    test" from the WO-9 definition of done -- one side is synthetic because
    there is one machine and no second player, exactly the constraint every
    other test script here works around.

    Needs: relay running, agent running and connected to it, game running via
    Modding Tools. No native DLL/injection required -- unlike combat,
    appearance never goes through the pipe; it is REST-only both ends.
