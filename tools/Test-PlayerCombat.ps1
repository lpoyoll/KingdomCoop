.SYNOPSIS
    WO-28 relay-level tests for the shared player combat layer (0x1F-0x25):
    continuous player health, NPC->player hits, player death, and the
    damage-authority role that gates them.

.DESCRIPTION
    Relay only -- no game, no agent, no DLL. Synthetic TCP peers speak the wire
    protocol directly, the same shape as tools/Test-Combat.ps1, so every routing
    and gating rule is checked without needing a second machine.

    What this can and cannot prove, stated plainly:

      CAN   the relay broadcasts PlayerStateUp to peers and not to the sender;
            it ROUTES PlayerHitUp to exactly the named player and nobody else;
            it DROPS a PlayerHitUp from a client that does not hold damage
            authority; it assigns the role to the lowest-id ready client and
            moves it when that client leaves; death broadcasts and is
            idempotent on the wire.

      CANNOT that an NPC hitting a ghost in one player's world actually hurts
            the other player in theirs. That crosses two real games and is
            covered by Test-PlayerVitalsE2E.ps1 (one real game) and, for the
            genuinely cross-machine step, by nothing available here -- see
            docs/WO-28-findings.md, which marks it unverified rather than
            quietly implying otherwise.

    Runs against an isolated relay on its own port by default so a live session
    on 7778 is never touched.
